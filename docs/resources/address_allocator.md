# f5xc_address_allocator (Resource)

Create Address Allocator will create an address allocator object in 'system' namespace of the user

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Address Allocator Resource Example
# Create Address Allocator will create an address allocator object in 'system' namespace of the user

# Basic Address Allocator configuration
resource "f5xc_address_allocator" "example" {
  name      = "my-address-allocator"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
    # Address Allocation Scheme. Decides the scheme to be used ...
    address_allocation_scheme {
      # Configure address_allocation_scheme settings
    }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

`name` - (Required) Name of the AddressAllocator. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the AddressAllocator will be created (`String`).


The following arguments are optional:

`address_allocation_scheme` - (Optional) Address Allocation Scheme. Decides the scheme to be used to allocate addresses from the configured address pool. See [Address Allocation Scheme](#address-allocation-scheme) below for details.

`address_pool` - (Optional) Address Pool. Address pool from which the allocator carves out subnets or addresses to its clients. Required: YES ves.io.schema.rules.message.required: true ves.io.schema.rules.repeated.items.string (`List`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`mode` - (Optional) Allocator Mode. Mode of the address allocator Address allocator is for VERs within the local cluster or site Allocation is per site and then per node (`String`).


### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="nestedblock--address_allocation_scheme"></a>
### Address Allocation Scheme

`allocation_unit` - (Optional) Allocation Unit. Prefix length indicating the size of each allocated subnet. For example, if this is specified as 30, subnets of /30 will be allocated from the given address pool. Required: YES ves (`Number`).

`local_interface_address_offset` - (Optional) Local Interface Address Offset. This is used to derive address for the local interface from the allocated subnet (`Number`).

`local_interface_address_type` - (Optional) Local Interface Address Type. Dictates how local interface address is derived from the allocated subnet Use Nth address of the allocated subnet as the local interface address, N being the Local Int... (`String`).


## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import using namespace/name format
terraform import f5xc_address_allocator.example system/example
```
