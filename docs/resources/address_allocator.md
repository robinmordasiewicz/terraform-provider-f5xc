# f5xc_address_allocator (Resource)

Manages Address Allocator will create an address allocator object in 'system' namespace of the user in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Address Allocator Resource Example
# Manages Address Allocator will create an address allocator object in 'system' namespace of the user in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Address Allocator configuration
resource "f5xc_address_allocator" "example" {
  name      = "example-address-allocator"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # Address Allocation Scheme. Decides the scheme to be used ...
  address_allocation_scheme {
    # Configure address_allocation_scheme settings
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the AddressAllocator. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the AddressAllocator will be created.

### Optional

- `address_allocation_scheme` (Block, Optional) Address Allocation Scheme. Decides the scheme to be used to allocate addresses from the configured address pool. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--address_allocation_scheme))
- `address_pool` (List of String) Address Pool. Address pool from which the allocator carves out subnets or addresses to its clients.
- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `mode` (String) Allocator Mode. Mode of the address allocator Address allocator is for VERs within the local cluster or site Allocation is per site and then per node. Possible values are `LOCAL`, `GLOBAL_PER_SITE_NODE`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

### Nested Schema for `address_allocation_scheme`

Optional:

- `allocation_unit` (Number) Allocation Unit. Prefix length indicating the size of each allocated subnet. For example, if this is specified as 30, subnets of /30 will be allocated from the given address pool.
- `local_interface_address_offset` (Number) Local Interface Address Offset. This is used to derive address for the local interface from the allocated subnet. If Local Interface Address Type is set to 'Offset from beginning of Subnet', this offset value is added to the allocated subnet and used as the local interface address. For example, if the allocated subnet is 169.254.0.0/30 and offset is set to 2 with Local Interface Address Type set to 'Offset from beginning of Subnet', local interface address of 169.254.0.2 is used. If Local Int...
- `local_interface_address_type` (String) Local Interface Address Type. Dictates how local interface address is derived from the allocated subnet Use Nth address of the allocated subnet as the local interface address, N being the Local Interface Address Offset. For example, if the allocated subnet is 169.254.0.0/30, Local Interface Address Offset is set to 2 and Local Interface Address Type is set to 'Offset from beginning of Subnet', local address of 169.254.0.2 is used. Use Nth last address of the allocated subnet as the local inte... Possible values are `LOCAL_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_OFFSET_FROM_SUBNET_BEGIN`, `LOCAL_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_OFFSET_FROM_SUBNET_END`, `LOCAL_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_FROM_PREFIX`.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Import using namespace/name format
