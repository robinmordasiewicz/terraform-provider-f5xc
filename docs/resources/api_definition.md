# Basic Api Definition configuration
resource "f5xc_api_definition" "example" {
  name      = "example-api-definition"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"

- `api_inventory_exclusion_list` (Block List) API Inventory Exclusion List. List of API Endpoints excluded from the API Inventory. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--api_inventory_exclusion_list))
- `api_inventory_inclusion_list` (Block List) API Inventory Inclusion List. List of API Endpoints included in the API Inventory. Typically, discovered API endpoints are added to the API Inventory using this list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--api_inventory_inclusion_list))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
