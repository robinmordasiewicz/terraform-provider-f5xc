`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`business_logic_markup_setting` - (Optional) API Discovery Settings. Settings specifying how API Discovery will be performed. See [Business Logic Markup Setting](#business-logic-markup-setting) below for details.

`features` - (Optional) Features. List of various AI/ML features enabled. See [Features](#features) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="business-logic-markup-setting"></a>

### Business Logic Markup Setting

`disable` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`discovered_api_settings` - (Optional) Discovered API Settings. x-example: '2' Configure Discovered API Settings. See [Discovered API Settings](#business-logic-markup-setting-discovered-api-settings) below.

`enable` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

<a id="business-logic-markup-setting-discovered-api-settings"></a>

### Business Logic Markup Setting Discovered API Settings

`purge_duration_for_inactive_discovered_apis` - (Optional) Purge Duration for Inactive Discovered APIs from Traffic. Inactive discovered API will be deleted after configured duration (`Number`).

<a id="features"></a>

### Features

`type` - (Optional) AI/ML Features. Enumeration for AI/ML features supported API Discovery enables generation of model for various API interactions between services of App type. Enable analysis of timeseries for various metric collected like requests, errors, latency etc. Enable anomaly detection per API request, i.e. the probability density function (PDF) charts generation for API endpoints Enable user behavior analysis. Possible values are `BUSINESS_LOGIC_MARKUP`, `TIMESERIES_ANOMALY_DETECTION`, `PER_REQ_ANOMALY_DETECTION`, `USER_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS`. Defaults to `BUSINESS_LOGIC_MARKUP` (`String`).

<a id="timeouts"></a>

### Timeouts

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).
