## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the AppType. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the AppType will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `business_logic_markup_setting` (Block, Optional) API Discovery Settings. Settings specifying how API Discovery will be performed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting))
- `features` (Block List) Features. List of various AI/ML features enabled (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--features))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting"></a>
### Nested Schema for `business_logic_markup_setting`

Optional:

- `disable` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting--disable))
- `discovered_api_settings` (Block, Optional) Discovered API Settings. x-example: '2' Configure Discovered API Settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting--discovered_api_settings))
- `enable` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting--enable))

<a id="nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting--disable"></a>
### Nested Schema for `business_logic_markup_setting.disable`


<a id="nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting--discovered_api_settings"></a>
### Nested Schema for `business_logic_markup_setting.discovered_api_settings`

Optional:

- `purge_duration_for_inactive_discovered_apis` (Number) Purge Duration for Inactive Discovered APIs from Traffic. Inactive discovered API will be deleted after configured duration.


<a id="nestedblock--business_logic_markup_setting--enable"></a>
### Nested Schema for `business_logic_markup_setting.enable`



<a id="nestedblock--features"></a>
### Nested Schema for `features`

Optional:

- `type` (String) AI/ML Features. Enumeration for AI/ML features supported API Discovery enables generation of model for various API interactions between services of App type. Enable analysis of timeseries for various metric collected like requests, errors, latency etc. Enable anomaly detection per API request, i.e. the probability density function (PDF) charts generation for API endpoints Enable user behavior analysis. Possible values are `BUSINESS_LOGIC_MARKUP`, `TIMESERIES_ANOMALY_DETECTION`, `PER_REQ_ANOMALY_DETECTION`, `USER_BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS`.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
