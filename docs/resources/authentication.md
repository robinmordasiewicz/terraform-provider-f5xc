## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the Authentication. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the Authentication will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`cookie_params` - (Optional) Cookie Parameters. Specifies different cookie related config parameters for authentication. See [Cookie Params](#cookie-params) below for details.

`oidc_auth` - (Optional) OIDCAuthType. See [Oidc Auth](#oidc-auth) below for details.

<a id="cookie-params"></a>

**Cookie Params**

`auth_hmac` - (Optional) HMAC Key Pair. HMAC primary and secondary keys to be used for hashing the Cookie. Each key also have an associated expiry timestamp, beyond which key is invalid. See [Auth HMAC](#cookie-params-auth-hmac) below.

`cookie_expiry` - (Optional) Cookie Expiry duration. specifies in seconds max duration of the allocated cookie. This maps to “Max-Age” attribute in the session cookie. This will act as an expiry duration on the client side after which client will not be setting the cookie as part of the request. Default cookie expiry is 3600 seconds (`Number`).

`cookie_refresh_interval` - (Optional) Cookie Refresh Interval. Specifies in seconds refresh interval for session cookie. This is used to keep the active user active and reduce RE-login. When an incoming cookie's session expiry is still valid, and time to expire falls behind this interval, RE-issue a cookie with new expiry and with the same original session expiry. Default refresh interval is 3000 seconds (`Number`).

`kms_key_hmac` - (Optional) KMS Key Reference. Reference to KMS Key Object (`Block`).

`session_expiry` - (Optional) Session Expiry duration. specifies in seconds max lifetime of an authenticated session after which the user will be forced to login again. Default session expiry is 86400 seconds(24 hours) (`Number`).
