## Example Usage

```terraform
# Aws Vpc Site Resource Example
# Manages a AWSVPCSite resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for deploying F5 sites within AWS VPC environments.

# Basic Aws Vpc Site configuration
resource "f5xc_aws_vpc_site" "example" {
  name      = "example-aws-vpc-site"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # AWS VPC Site configuration
  aws_region = "us-west-2"

  # AWS credentials reference
  aws_cred {
    name      = "aws-credentials"
    namespace = "system"
  }

  # VPC configuration
  vpc {
    new_vpc {
      name_tag     = "f5xc-vpc"
      primary_ipv4 = "10.0.0.0/16"
    }
