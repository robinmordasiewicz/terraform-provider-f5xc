# f5xc_bgp_routing_policy (Resource)

Manages a BGPRoutingPolicy resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for bgp routing policy is a list of rules containing match criteria and action to be applied. these rules help contol routes which are imported or exported to bgp peers configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Bgp Routing Policy Resource Example
# Manages a BGPRoutingPolicy resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for bgp routing policy is a list of rules containing match criteria and action to be applied. these rules help contol routes which are imported or exported to bgp peers configuration.

# Basic Bgp Routing Policy configuration
resource "f5xc_bgp_routing_policy" "example" {
  name      = "example-bgp-routing-policy"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the BGPRoutingPolicy. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the BGPRoutingPolicy will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `rules` (Block List) Rules. A BGP Routing policy is composed of one or more rules. Note that the order of rules is critical as rules are applied top to bottom. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules`

Optional:

- `action` (Block, Optional) BGP Route Action. Action to be enforced if the BGP route matches the rule. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules--action))
- `match` (Block, Optional) BGP Route Match. Predicates which have to match information in route for action to be applied (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules--match))

<a id="nestedblock--rules--action"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rules.action`

Optional:

- `aggregate` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules--action--aggregate))
- `allow` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules--action--allow))
- `as_path` (String) AS-path to prepend. AS-Path Prepending is generally used to influence incoming traffic
- `community` (Block, Optional) BGP Community list. List of BGP communities (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules--action--community))
- `deny` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rules--action--deny))
- `local_preference` (Number) Local preference. BGP Local Preference is generally used to influence outgoing traffic
- `metric` (Number) MED/Metric. The Multi-Exit Discriminator metric to indicate the preferred path to AS

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
