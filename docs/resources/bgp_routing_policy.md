# f5xc_bgp_routing_policy (Resource)

Manages a BGPRoutingPolicy resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for bgp routing policy is a list of rules containing match criteria and action to be applied. these rules help contol routes which are imported or exported to bgp peers configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Bgp Routing Policy Resource Example
# Manages a BGPRoutingPolicy resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for bgp routing policy is a list of rules containing match criteria and action to be applied. these rules help contol routes which are imported or exported to bgp peers configuration.

# Basic Bgp Routing Policy configuration
resource "f5xc_bgp_routing_policy" "example" {
  name      = "example-bgp-routing-policy"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the BGPRoutingPolicy. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the BGPRoutingPolicy will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`rules` - (Optional) Rules. A BGP Routing policy is composed of one or more rules. Note that the order of rules is critical as rules are applied top to bottom. See [Rules](#rules) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="rules"></a>

**Rules**

`action` - (Optional) BGP Route Action. Action to be enforced if the BGP route matches the rule. See [Action](#rules-action) below.

`match` - (Optional) BGP Route Match. Predicates which have to match information in route for action to be applied. See [Match](#rules-match) below.

<a id="rules-action"></a>

**Rules Action**

`aggregate` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`allow` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`as_path` - (Optional) AS-path to prepend. AS-Path Prepending is generally used to influence incoming traffic (`String`).

`community` - (Optional) BGP Community list. List of BGP communities. See [Community](#rules-action-community) below.

`deny` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`local_preference` - (Optional) Local preference. BGP Local Preference is generally used to influence outgoing traffic (`Number`).

`metric` - (Optional) MED/Metric. The Multi-Exit Discriminator metric to indicate the preferred path to AS (`Number`).

<a id="rules-action-community"></a>

**Rules Action Community**

`community` - (Optional) BGP community. An unordered set of RFC 1997 defined 4-byte community, first 16 bits being ASN and lower 16 bits being value (`List`).

<a id="rules-match"></a>

**Rules Match**

`as_path` - (Optional) AS path to match. AS path can also be a regex, which will be matched against route information (`String`).

`community` - (Optional) BGP Community list. List of BGP communities. See [Community](#rules-match-community) below.

`ip_prefixes` - (Optional) BGP Prefix List. List of IP prefix and prefix length range match condition. See [IP Prefixes](#rules-match-ip-prefixes) below.

<a id="rules-match-community"></a>

**Rules Match Community**

`community` - (Optional) BGP community. An unordered set of RFC 1997 defined 4-byte community, first 16 bits being ASN and lower 16 bits being value (`List`).

<a id="rules-match-ip-prefixes"></a>

**Rules Match IP Prefixes**

`prefixes` - (Optional) Prefix list. List of IP prefix (`Block`).

<a id="timeouts"></a>

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs (`String`).

`read` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled (`String`).

`update` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).
