-> **One of the following:**
&#x2022; <a id="captcha-challenge"></a>[`captcha_challenge`](#captcha-challenge) - Optional Block<br>Captcha Challenge Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to perform captcha challenge Captcha challenge will be based on Google Recaptcha. With this feature enabled, only clients that pass the captcha challenge will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Captcha Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have captcha challenge embedded in it. Client will be allowed to make the request only if the captcha challenge is successful. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Captcha challenge for subsequent requests. CAPTCHA is mainly used as a security check to ensure only human users can pass through. Generally, computers or bots are not capable of solving a captcha. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host
<br><br>&#x2022; <a id="enable-challenge"></a>[`enable_challenge`](#enable-challenge) - Optional Block<br>Enable Malicious User Challenge. Configure auto mitigation i.e risk based challenges for malicious users
<br><br>&#x2022; <a id="js-challenge"></a>[`js_challenge`](#js-challenge) - Optional Block<br>Javascript Challenge Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to perform client browser compatibility test by redirecting to a page with Javascript. With this feature enabled, only clients that are capable of executing Javascript(mostly browsers) will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Javascript Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have Javascript embedded in it. Loadbalancer chooses a set of random numbers for every new client and sends these numbers along with an encrypted answer with the request such that it embed these numbers as input in the Javascript. Javascript will run on the requestor browser and perform a complex Math operation. Script will submit the answer to loadbalancer. Loadbalancer will validate the answer by comparing the calculated answer with the decrypted answer (which was encrypted when it was sent back as reply) and allow the request to the upstream server only if the answer is correct. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Javascript challenge for subsequent requests. Javascript challenge serves following purposes * Validate that the request is coming via a browser that is capable for running Javascript * Force the browser to run a complex operation, f(X), that requires it to spend a large number of CPU cycles. This is to slow down a potential DOS attacker by making it difficult to launch a large request flood without having to spend even larger CPU cost at their end. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host

<a id="csrf-policy"></a>&#x2022; [`csrf_policy`](#csrf-policy) - Optional Block<br>CSRF Policy. To mitigate CSRF attack , the policy checks where a request is coming from to determine if the request's origin is the same as its detination.The policy relies on two pieces of information used in determining if a request originated from the same host. 1. The origin that caused the user agent to issue the request (source origin). 2. The origin that the request is going to (target origin). When the policy evaluating a request, it ensures both pieces of information are present and compare their values. If the source origin is missing or origins do not match the request is rejected. The exception to this being if the source-origin has been added to they policy as valid. Because CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, the policy only acts on the HTTP requests that have state-changing method (PUT,POST, etc.)

Enables loadbalancer to perform captcha challenge Captcha challenge will be based on Google Recaptcha. With this feature enabled, only clients that pass the captcha challenge will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Captcha Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have captcha challenge embedded in it. Client will be allowed to make the request only if the captcha challenge is successful. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Captcha challenge for subsequent requests. CAPTCHA is mainly used as a security check to ensure only human users can pass through. Generally, computers or bots are not capable of solving a captcha. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host<br>See [Captcha Challenge Parameters](#enable-challenge-captcha-challenge-parameters) below.

Enables loadbalancer to perform client browser compatibility test by redirecting to a page with Javascript. With this feature enabled, only clients that are capable of executing Javascript(mostly browsers) will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Javascript Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have Javascript embedded in it. Loadbalancer chooses a set of random numbers for every new client and sends these numbers along with an encrypted answer with the request such that it embed these numbers as input in the Javascript. Javascript will run on the requestor browser and perform a complex Math operation. Script will submit the answer to loadbalancer. Loadbalancer will validate the answer by comparing the calculated answer with the decrypted answer (which was encrypted when it was sent back as reply) and allow the request to the upstream server only if the answer is correct. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Javascript challenge for subsequent requests. Javascript challenge serves following purposes * Validate that the request is coming via a browser that is capable for running Javascript * Force the browser to run a complex operation, f(X), that requires it to spend a large number of CPU cycles. This is to slow down a potential DOS attacker by making it difficult to launch a large request flood without having to spend even larger CPU cost at their end. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host<br>See [Js Challenge Parameters](#enable-challenge-js-challenge-parameters) below.

Client will be allowed to make the request only if the captcha challenge is successful. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Captcha challenge for subsequent requests. CAPTCHA is mainly used as a security check to ensure only human users can pass through. Generally, computers or bots are not capable of solving a captcha. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host<br>See [Captcha Challenge Parameters](#policy-based-challenge-captcha-challenge-parameters) below.

<a id="policy-based-challenge-js-challenge-parameters"></a>&#x2022; [`js_challenge_parameters`](#policy-based-challenge-js-challenge-parameters) - Optional Block<br>Javascript Challenge Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to perform client browser compatibility test by redirecting to a page with Javascript. With this feature enabled, only clients that are capable of executing Javascript(mostly browsers) will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Javascript Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have Javascript embedded in it. Loadbalancer chooses a set of random numbers for every new client and sends these numbers along with an encrypted answer with the request such that it embed these numbers as input in the Javascript. Javascript will run on the requestor browser and perform a complex Math operation. Script will submit the answer to loadbalancer. Loadbalancer will validate the answer by comparing the calculated answer with the decrypted answer (which was encrypted when it was sent back as reply) and allow the request to the upstream server only if the answer is correct. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Javascript challenge for subsequent requests. Javascript challenge serves following purposes * Validate that the request is coming via a browser that is capable for running Javascript * Force the browser to run a complex operation, f(X), that requires it to spend a large number of CPU cycles. This is to slow down a potential DOS attacker by making it difficult to launch a large request flood without having to spend even larger CPU cost at their end.
