# f5xc_certificate (Resource)

Manages a Certificate resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for TLS/SSL certificate management.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Certificate Resource Example
# Manages a Certificate resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for TLS/SSL certificate management.

# Basic Certificate configuration
resource "f5xc_certificate" "example" {
  name      = "example-certificate"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Certificate configuration
  certificate_url = "string:///LS0tLS1CRUdJTi..."
  private_key {
    clear_secret_info {
      url = "string:///LS0tLS1CRUdJTi..."
    }
  }
}

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the Certificate. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the Certificate will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`certificate_chain` - (Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name. See [Certificate Chain](#certificate-chain) below for details.

`certificate_url` - (Optional) Certificate. Certificate. Certificate or certificate chain in PEM format including the PEM headers (`String`).

-> **Only one of the following may be set:**
`custom_hash_algorithms` - (Optional) Hash Algorithms. Specifies the hash algorithms to be used. See [Custom Hash Algorithms](#custom-hash-algorithms) below for details.
<br>`disable_ocsp_stapling` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).
<br>`use_system_defaults` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`private_key` - (Optional) Secret. SecretType is used in an object to indicate a sensitive/confidential field. See [Private Key](#private-key) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="certificate-chain"></a>

**Certificate Chain**

`name` - (Optional) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name (`String`).

`namespace` - (Optional) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace (`String`).

`tenant` - (Optional) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant (`String`).

<a id="custom-hash-algorithms"></a>

**Custom Hash Algorithms**

`hash_algorithms` - (Optional) Hash Algorithms. Ordered list of hash algorithms to be used. Possible values are `INVALID_HASH_ALGORITHM`, `SHA256`, `SHA1`. Defaults to `INVALID_HASH_ALGORITHM` (`List`).

<a id="private-key"></a>

**Private Key**

`blindfold_secret_info` - (Optional) Blindfold Secret. BlindfoldSecretInfoType specifies information about the Secret managed by F5XC Secret Management. See [Blindfold Secret Info](#private-key-blindfold-secret-info) below.

`clear_secret_info` - (Optional) In-Clear Secret. ClearSecretInfoType specifies information about the Secret that is not encrypted. See [Clear Secret Info](#private-key-clear-secret-info) below.

<a id="private-key-blindfold-secret-info"></a>

**Private Key Blindfold Secret Info**

`decryption_provider` - (Optional) Decryption Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the backend Secret Management service (`String`).

`location` - (Optional) Location. Location is the uri_ref. It could be in URL format for string:/// Or it could be a path if the store provider is an HTTP/HTTPS location (`String`).

`store_provider` - (Optional) Store Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the store to get encrypted bytes This field needs to be provided only if the URL scheme is not string:/// (`String`).

<a id="private-key-clear-secret-info"></a>

**Private Key Clear Secret Info**

`provider_ref` - (Optional) Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the store to get encrypted bytes This field needs to be provided only if the URL scheme is not string:/// (`String`).

`url` - (Optional) URL. URL of the secret. Currently supported URL schemes is string:///. For string:/// scheme, Secret needs to be encoded Base64 format. When asked for this secret, caller will get Secret bytes after Base64 decoding (`String`).

<a id="timeouts"></a>

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs (`String`).

`read` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled (`String`).

`update` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).
