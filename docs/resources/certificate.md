# f5xc_certificate (Resource)

Manages a Certificate resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for TLS/SSL certificate management.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Certificate Resource Example
# Manages a Certificate resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for TLS/SSL certificate management.

# Basic Certificate configuration
resource "f5xc_certificate" "example" {
  name      = "example-certificate"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Certificate configuration
  certificate_url = "string:///LS0tLS1CRUdJTi..."
  private_key {
    clear_secret_info {
      url = "string:///LS0tLS1CRUdJTi..."
    }
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the Certificate. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the Certificate will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `certificate_chain` (Block, Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--certificate_chain))
- `certificate_url` (String) Certificate. Certificate. Certificate or certificate chain in PEM format including the PEM headers.
- `custom_hash_algorithms` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: custom_hash_algorithms, disable_ocsp_stapling, use_system_defaults] Hash Algorithms. Specifies the hash algorithms to be used (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--custom_hash_algorithms))
- `disable_ocsp_stapling` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--disable_ocsp_stapling))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `private_key` (Block, Optional) Secret. SecretType is used in an object to indicate a sensitive/confidential field (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--private_key))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `use_system_defaults` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--use_system_defaults))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--certificate_chain"></a>
### Nested Schema for `certificate_chain`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.


<a id="nestedblock--custom_hash_algorithms"></a>
### Nested Schema for `custom_hash_algorithms`

Optional:

- `hash_algorithms` (List of String) Hash Algorithms. Ordered list of hash algorithms to be used.


<a id="nestedblock--disable_ocsp_stapling"></a>
### Nested Schema for `disable_ocsp_stapling`


<a id="nestedblock--private_key"></a>
### Nested Schema for `private_key`

Optional:

- `blindfold_secret_info` (Block, Optional) Blindfold Secret. BlindfoldSecretInfoType specifies information about the Secret managed by F5XC Secret Management (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--private_key--blindfold_secret_info))
- `clear_secret_info` (Block, Optional) In-Clear Secret. ClearSecretInfoType specifies information about the Secret that is not encrypted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--private_key--clear_secret_info))

<a id="nestedblock--private_key--blindfold_secret_info"></a>
### Nested Schema for `private_key.blindfold_secret_info`

Optional:

- `decryption_provider` (String) Decryption Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the backend Secret Management service.
- `location` (String) Location. Location is the uri_ref. It could be in url format for string:/// Or it could be a path if the store provider is an http/https location
- `store_provider` (String) Store Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the store to get encrypted bytes This field needs to be provided only if the url scheme is not string:///


<a id="nestedblock--private_key--clear_secret_info"></a>
### Nested Schema for `private_key.clear_secret_info`

Optional:

- `provider_ref` (String) Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the store to get encrypted bytes This field needs to be provided only if the url scheme is not string:///
- `url` (String) URL. URL of the secret. Currently supported URL schemes is string:///. For string:/// scheme, Secret needs to be encoded Base64 format. When asked for this secret, caller will get Secret bytes after Base64 decoding.



<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
