## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the ChildTenantManager. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the ChildTenantManager will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`group_assignments` - (Optional) Group Mapping. The Group Mapping field is used to associate local user groups with user groups in child tenants. See [Group Assignments](#group-assignments) below for details.

`tenant_owner_group` - (Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name. See [Tenant Owner Group](#tenant-owner-group) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="group-assignments"></a>

### Group Assignments

`child_tenant_groups` - (Optional) Child Tenant User Groups. List of group names in child tenant. Note - To establish access, child tenant group names must be a subset of child tenant groups configured in tenant profile. Once it's setup, when user from msp tenant access child tenant, underlying roles from child tenant will be applied to user (`List`).

`group` - (Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name. See [Group](#group-assignments-group) below.

<a id="group-assignments-group"></a>

### Group Assignments Group

`name` - (Optional) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name (`String`).

`namespace` - (Optional) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace (`String`).

`tenant` - (Optional) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant (`String`).

<a id="tenant-owner-group"></a>

### Tenant Owner Group

`name` - (Optional) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name (`String`).

`namespace` - (Optional) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace (`String`).

`tenant` - (Optional) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant (`String`).

<a id="timeouts"></a>

### Timeouts

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
