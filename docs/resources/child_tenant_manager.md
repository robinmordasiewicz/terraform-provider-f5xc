## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the ChildTenantManager. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the ChildTenantManager will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `group_assignments` (Block List) Group Mapping. The Group Mapping field is used to associate local user groups with user groups in child tenants. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group_assignments))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `tenant_owner_group` (Block, Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tenant_owner_group))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--group_assignments"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_assignments`

Optional:

- `child_tenant_groups` (List of String) Child Tenant User Groups. List of group names in child tenant. Note - To establish access, child tenant group names must be a subset of child tenant groups configured in tenant profile. Once it's setup, when user from msp tenant access child tenant, underlying roles from child tenant will be applied to user.
- `group` (Block, Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--group_assignments--group))

<a id="nestedblock--group_assignments--group"></a>
### Nested Schema for `group_assignments.group`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.



<a id="nestedblock--tenant_owner_group"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tenant_owner_group`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
