- `default_subset` (Block, Optional) Default Subset. List of key-value pairs that define default subset. This subset can be referred in fallback_policy which gets used when route specifies no metadata or no subset matching the metadata exists. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--default_subset))
- `disable_proxy_protocol` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: disable_proxy_protocol, proxy_protocol_v1, proxy_protocol_v2] Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--disable_proxy_protocol))

Policy for selection of endpoints from local site/remote site/both Consider both remote and local endpoints for load balancing LOCAL_ONLY: Consider only local endpoints for load balancing Enable this policy to load balance ONLY among locally discovered endpoints Prefer the local endpoints for load balancing. If local endpoints are not present remote endpoints will be considered. Possible values are `DISTRIBUTED`, `LOCAL_ONLY`, `LOCAL_PREFERRED`.
- `endpoint_subsets` (Block List) Endpoint Subsets. Cluster may be configured to divide its endpoints into subsets based on metadata attached to the endpoints. Routes may then specify the metadata that a endpoint must match in order to be selected by the load balancer. endpoint_subsets is list of subsets for this cluster. Each entry in this list has definition for a subset (which is collection of keys) During routing, the route’s metadata match configuration is used to find a specific subset. If there is a subset with the e... (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--endpoint_subsets))
- `endpoints` (Block List) Endpoints. List of references to all endpoint objects that belong to this cluster. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--endpoints))
- `fallback_policy` (String) Subset Fallback Policy. Enumeration for SubsetFallbackPolicy if subset match is not found. The request fails as if the cluster had no endpoint matching the subset policy Any cluster endpoint may be selected if the cluster had no endpoint matching the subset policy Load balancing is done over endpoints matching default_subset if the cluster had no endpoint matching the subset policy.

- `http_idle_timeout` (Number) HTTP Idle Timeout. The idle timeout for upstream connection pool connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. When the idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive. This is specified in milliseconds. The default value is 5 minutes.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `loadbalancer_algorithm` (String) Load Balancer Algorithm. Different load balancing algorithms supported When a connection to a endpoint in an upstream cluster is required, the load balancer uses loadbalancer_algorithm to determine which host is selected. - ROUND_ROBIN: ROUND_ROBIN Policy in which each healthy/available upstream endpoint is selected in round robin order. - LEAST_REQUEST: LEAST_REQUEST Policy in which loadbalancer picks the upstream endpoint which has the fewest active requests - RING_HASH: RING_HASH Policy im... Possible values are `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, `RING_HASH`, `RANDOM`, `LB_OVERRIDE`.

- `outlier_detection` (Block, Optional) Outlier Detection. Outlier detection and ejection is the process of dynamically determining whether some number of hosts in an upstream cluster are performing unlike the others and removing them from the healthy load balancing set. Outlier detection is a form of passive health checking. Algorithm 1. A endpoint is determined to be an outlier (based on configured number of consecutive_5xx or consecutive_gateway_failures) . 2. If no endpoints have been ejected, loadbalancer will eject the host i... (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--outlier_detection))

<a id="nestedblock--circuit_breaker"></a>
### Nested Schema for `circuit_breaker`

Optional:

- `connection_limit` (Number) Connection Limit. The maximum number of connections that loadbalancer will establish to all hosts in an upstream cluster. In practice this is only applicable to TCP and HTTP/1.1 clusters since HTTP/2 uses a single connection to each host. Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if number of connections reach connection limit.
- `max_requests` (Number) Maximum Request Count. The maximum number of requests that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time. In practice this is applicable to HTTP/2 clusters since HTTP/1.1 clusters are governed by the maximum connections (connection_limit). Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if requests exceed this count.
- `pending_requests` (Number) Pending Requests. The maximum number of requests that will be queued while waiting for a ready connection pool connection. Since HTTP/2 requests are sent over a single connection, this circuit breaker only comes into play as the initial connection is created, as requests will be multiplexed immediately afterwards. For HTTP/1.1, requests are added to the list of pending requests whenever there aren’t enough upstream connections available to immediately dispatch the request, so this circuit b...
- `priority` (String) Routing Priority. Priority routing for each request. Different connection pools are used based on the priority selected for the request. Also, circuit-breaker configuration at destination cluster is chosen based on selected priority. Default routing mechanism High-Priority routing mechanism. Possible values are `DEFAULT`, `HIGH`.
- `retries` (Number) Retry Count. The maximum number of retries that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time. Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if retries for request exceed this count.
