<a id="circuit-breaker"></a>&#x2022; [`circuit_breaker`](#circuit-breaker) - Optional Block<br>Circuit Breaker.

Policy for selection of endpoints from local site/remote site/both Consider both remote and local endpoints for load balancing LOCAL_ONLY: Consider only local endpoints for load balancing Enable this policy to load balance ONLY among locally discovered endpoints Prefer the local endpoints for load balancing. If local endpoints are not present remote endpoints will be considered

<a id="endpoint-subsets"></a>&#x2022; [`endpoint_subsets`](#endpoint-subsets) - Optional Block<br>Endpoint Subsets. Cluster may be configured to divide its endpoints into subsets based on metadata attached to the endpoints. Routes may then specify the metadata that a endpoint must match in order to be selected by the load balancer. endpoint_subsets is list of subsets for this cluster. Each entry in this list has definition for a subset (which is collection of keys) During routing, the route’s metadata match configuration is used to find a specific subset. If there is a subset with the exact keys and values specified by the route, the subset is used for load balancing. Otherwise, the fallback policy is used. The cluster’s subset configuration must, therefore, contain a definition that has the same keys as a given route in order for subset load balancing to occur. RouteConfig routes: - match: - headers: [] path: path: /1.log query_params: [] routeDestination: destinations: - cluster: - kind: cluster.Object uid: 00000000-0000-0000-0001-000000000005 endpointSubsets: site: india EndpointConfig metadata: labels: deployment: debug site: india name: end-1 uid: end-1 ClusterConfig gcSpec: defaultSubset: stage: production fallbackPolicy: DEFAULT_SUBSET endpointSubsets: - keys: - site - keys: - stage - app Assume the below endpoints are defined and associated with the cluster.

<a id="fallback-policy"></a>&#x2022; [`fallback_policy`](#fallback-policy) - Optional String  Defaults to `NO_FALLBACK`<br>Possible values are `NO_FALLBACK`, `ANY_ENDPOINT`, `DEFAULT_SUBSET`<br>[Enum: NO_FALLBACK|ANY_ENDPOINT|DEFAULT_SUBSET] Subset Fallback Policy.

<a id="http-idle-timeout"></a>&#x2022; [`http_idle_timeout`](#http-idle-timeout) - Optional Number  Defaults to `5`  Specified in milliseconds<br>HTTP Idle Timeout. The idle timeout for upstream connection pool connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. When the idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive.  The minutes

<a id="loadbalancer-algorithm"></a>&#x2022; [`loadbalancer_algorithm`](#loadbalancer-algorithm) - Optional String  Defaults to `ROUND_ROBIN`<br>Possible values are `ROUND_ROBIN`, `LEAST_REQUEST`, `RING_HASH`, `RANDOM`, `LB_OVERRIDE`<br>[Enum: ROUND_ROBIN|LEAST_REQUEST|RING_HASH|RANDOM|LB_OVERRIDE] Load Balancer Algorithm. Different load balancing algorithms supported When a connection to a endpoint in an upstream cluster is required, the load balancer uses loadbalancer_algorithm to determine which host is selected. - ROUND_ROBIN: ROUND_ROBIN Policy in which each healthy/available upstream endpoint is selected in round robin order. - LEAST_REQUEST: LEAST_REQUEST Policy in which loadbalancer picks the upstream endpoint which has the fewest active requests - RING_HASH: RING_HASH Policy implements consistent hashing to upstream endpoints using ring hash of endpoint names Hash of the incoming request is calculated using request hash policy. The ring/modulo hash load balancer implements consistent hashing to upstream hosts. The algorithm is based on mapping all hosts onto a circle such that the addition or removal of a host from the host set changes only affect 1/N requests. This technique is also commonly known as “ketama” hashing. A consistent hashing load balancer is only effective when protocol routing is used that specifies a value to hash on. The minimum ring size governs the replication factor for each host in the ring. For example, if the minimum ring size is 1024 and there are 16 hosts, each host will be replicated 64 times. - RANDOM: RANDOM Policy in which each available upstream endpoint is selected in random order. The random load balancer selects a random healthy host. The random load balancer generally performs better than round robin if no health checking policy is configured. Random selection avoids bias towards the host in the set that comes after a failed host. - LB_OVERRIDE: Load Balancer Override Hash policy is taken from from the load balancer which is using this origin pool

-> **One of the following:**
&#x2022; <a id="no-panic-threshold"></a>[`no_panic_threshold`](#no-panic-threshold) - Optional Block<br>Enable this option

<a id="outlier-detection"></a>&#x2022; [`outlier_detection`](#outlier-detection) - Optional Block<br>Outlier Detection. Outlier detection and ejection is the process of dynamically determining whether some number of hosts in an upstream cluster are performing unlike the others and removing them from the healthy load balancing set. Outlier detection is a form of passive health checking. Algorithm 1. A endpoint is determined to be an outlier (based on configured number of consecutive_5xx or consecutive_gateway_failures) . 2. If no endpoints have been ejected, loadbalancer will eject the host immediately. Otherwise, it checks to make sure the number of ejected hosts is below the allowed threshold (specified via max_ejection_percent setting). If the number of ejected hosts is above the threshold, the host is not ejected. 3. The endpoint is ejected for some number of milliseconds. Ejection means that the endpoint is marked unhealthy and will not be used during load balancing. The number of milliseconds is equal to the base_ejection_time value multiplied by the number of times the host has been ejected. 4. An ejected endpoint will automatically be brought back into service after the ejection time has been satisfied<br>See [Outlier Detection](#outlier-detection) below for details.

The maximum number of connections that loadbalancer will establish to all hosts in an upstream cluster. In practice this is only applicable to TCP and HTTP/1.1 clusters since HTTP/2 uses a single connection to each host. Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if number of connections reach connection limit

<a id="circuit-breaker-max-requests"></a>&#x2022; [`max_requests`](#circuit-breaker-max-requests) - Optional Number<br>Maximum Request Count. The maximum number of requests that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time. In practice this is applicable to HTTP/2 clusters since HTTP/1.1 clusters are governed by the maximum connections (connection_limit). Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if requests exceed this count

<a id="circuit-breaker-pending-requests"></a>&#x2022; [`pending_requests`](#circuit-breaker-pending-requests) - Optional Number<br>Pending Requests. The maximum number of requests that will be queued while waiting for a ready connection pool connection. Since HTTP/2 requests are sent over a single connection, this circuit breaker only comes into play as the initial connection is created, as requests will be multiplexed immediately afterwards. For HTTP/1.1, requests are added to the list of pending requests whenever there aren’t enough upstream connections available to immediately dispatch the request, so this circuit breaker will remain in play for the lifetime of the process. Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if pending request reach pending_request
