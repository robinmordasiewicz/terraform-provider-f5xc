> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "auto_http_config, http1_config, http2_options" must be set.

`auto_http_config` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed. See [Auto HTTP Config](#auto-http-config) below for details.

`circuit_breaker` - (Optional) Circuit Breaker. CircuitBreaker provides a mechanism for watching failures in upstream connections or requests and if the failures reach a certain threshold, automatically fail subsequent requests which allows to apply back pressure on downstream quickly. See [Circuit Breaker](#circuit-breaker) below for details.

`default_subset` - (Optional) Default Subset. List of key-value pairs that define default subset. This subset can be referred in fallback_policy which gets used when route specifies no metadata or no subset matching the metadata exists. See [Default Subset](#default-subset) below for details.

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "disable_proxy_protocol, proxy_protocol_v1, proxy_protocol_v2" must be set.

`disable_proxy_protocol` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed. See [Disable Proxy Protocol](#disable-proxy-protocol) below for details.

Policy for selection of endpoints from local site/remote site/both Consider both remote and local endpoints for load balancing LOCAL_ONLY: Consider only local endpoints for load balancing Enable this policy to load balance ONLY among locally discovered endpoints Prefer the local endpoints for load balancing. If local endpoints are not present remote endpoints will be considered. Possible values are `DISTRIBUTED`, `LOCAL_ONLY`, `LOCAL_PREFERRED`. Defaults to `DISTRIBUTED` (`String`).

`endpoint_subsets` - (Optional) Endpoint Subsets. Cluster may be configured to divide its endpoints into subsets based on metadata attached to the endpoints. Routes may then specify the metadata that a endpoint must match in order to be selected by the load balancer. endpoint_subsets is list of subsets for this cluster. Each entry in this list has definition for a subset (which is collection of keys) During routing, the route’s metadata match configuration is used to find a specific subset. If there is a subset with the e... See [Endpoint Subsets](#endpoint-subsets) below for details.

`endpoints` - (Optional) Endpoints. List of references to all endpoint objects that belong to this cluster. See [Endpoints](#endpoints) below for details.

`fallback_policy` - (Optional) Subset Fallback Policy. Enumeration for SubsetFallbackPolicy if subset match is not found.

`http_idle_timeout` - (Optional) HTTP Idle Timeout. The idle timeout for upstream connection pool connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. When the idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive. This is specified in milliseconds. The default value is 5 minutes (`Number`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`loadbalancer_algorithm` - (Optional) Load Balancer Algorithm. Different load balancing algorithms supported When a connection to a endpoint in an upstream cluster is required, the load balancer uses loadbalancer_algorithm to determine which host is selected. - ROUND_ROBIN: ROUND_ROBIN Policy in which each healthy/available upstream endpoint is selected in round robin order. - LEAST_REQUEST: LEAST_REQUEST Policy in which loadbalancer picks the upstream endpoint which has the fewest active requests - RING_HASH: RING_HASH Policy im...

Outlier detection and ejection is the process of dynamically determining whether some number of hosts in an upstream cluster are performing unlike the others and removing them from the healthy load balancing set. Outlier detection is a form of passive health checking. Algorithm 1. A endpoint is determined to be an outlier (based on configured number of consecutive_5xx or consecutive_gateway_failures) . 2.

### Circuit Breaker

`connection_limit` - (Optional) Connection Limit. The maximum number of connections that loadbalancer will establish to all hosts in an upstream cluster.

`max_requests` - (Optional) Maximum Request Count. The maximum number of requests that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time.

Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if requests exceed this count (`Number`).

`pending_requests` - (Optional) Pending Requests. The maximum number of requests that will be queued while waiting for a ready connection pool connection. Since HTTP/2 requests are sent over a single connection, this circuit breaker only comes into play as the initial connection is created, as requests will be multiplexed immediately afterwards.

Also, circuit-breaker configuration at destination cluster is chosen based on selected priority. Default routing mechanism High-Priority routing mechanism. Possible values are `DEFAULT`, `HIGH`. Defaults to `DEFAULT` (`String`).
