- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the Cminstance will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `api_token` (Block, Optional) Secret. SecretType is used in an object to indicate a sensitive/confidential field (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--api_token))
- `ip` (Block, Optional) IPv4 Address. IPv4 Address in dot-decimal notation (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ip))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.

- `port` (Number) Port. Port of the Central Manager instance to connect to
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `username` (String) Username. Username for the Central Manager instance

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

### Nested Schema for `api_token`

Optional:

- `blindfold_secret_info` (Block, Optional) Blindfold Secret. BlindfoldSecretInfoType specifies information about the Secret managed by F5XC Secret Management (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--api_token--blindfold_secret_info))
- `clear_secret_info` (Block, Optional) In-Clear Secret. ClearSecretInfoType specifies information about the Secret that is not encrypted. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--api_token--clear_secret_info))

### Nested Schema for `api_token.blindfold_secret_info`

Optional:

- `decryption_provider` (String) Decryption Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the backend Secret Management service.
- `location` (String) Location. Location is the uri_ref. It could be in url format for string:/// Or it could be a path if the store provider is an http/https location
- `store_provider` (String) Store Provider. Name of the Secret Management Access object that contains information about the store to get encrypted bytes This field needs to be provided only if the url scheme is not string:///
