  name      = "example-data-group"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
    # [OneOf: address_records, integer_records, string_records]...
    address_records {
      # Configure address_records settings
    }
    # Address records.
    records {
      # Configure records settings
    }

### Nested Schema for `address_records.records`



<a id="nestedblock--integer_records"></a>
### Nested Schema for `integer_records`

Optional:

- `records` (Block, Optional) Integer records. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--integer_records--records))

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
