# f5xc_dns_lb_health_check (Resource)

Manages DNS Load Balancer Health Check in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Dns Lb Health Check Resource Example
# Manages DNS Load Balancer Health Check in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Dns Lb Health Check configuration
resource "f5xc_dns_lb_health_check" "example" {
  name      = "example-dns-lb-health-check"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
    # [OneOf: http_health_check, https_health_check, icmp_healt...
    http_health_check {
      # Configure http_health_check settings
    }
    # HTTP Health Check.
    https_health_check {
      # Configure https_health_check settings
    }
    # Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are ...
    icmp_health_check {
      # Configure icmp_health_check settings
    }
}

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--http_health_check"></a>
### Nested Schema for `http_health_check`

Optional:

- `health_check_port` (Number) Health Check Port. Port used for performing health check
- `health_check_secondary_port` (Number) Health Check Secondary Port. Secondary port used for performing health check. If included, both ports must be healthy for the health check to pass
- `receive` (String) Receive String. Regular expression used to match against the response to the health check's request. Mark node up upon receipt of a successful regular expression match. Uses re2 regular expression syntax.
- `send` (String) Send String. HTTP payload to send to the target


<a id="nestedblock--https_health_check"></a>
### Nested Schema for `https_health_check`

Optional:

- `health_check_port` (Number) Health Check Port. Port used for performing health check
- `health_check_secondary_port` (Number) Health Check Secondary Port. Secondary port used for performing health check. If included, both ports must be healthy for the health check to pass
- `receive` (String) Receive String. Regular expression used to match against the response to the health check's request. Mark node up upon receipt of a successful regular expression match. Uses re2 regular expression syntax.
- `send` (String) Send String. HTTP payload to send to the target
