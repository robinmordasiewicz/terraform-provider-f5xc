# f5xc_dns_lb_health_check (Resource)

Manages DNS Load Balancer Health Check in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Dns Lb Health Check Resource Example
# Manages DNS Load Balancer Health Check in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Dns Lb Health Check configuration
resource "f5xc_dns_lb_health_check" "example" {
  name      = "example-dns-lb-health-check"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # [OneOf: http_health_check, https_health_check, icmp_healt...
  http_health_check {
    # Configure http_health_check settings
  }
  # HTTP Health Check.
  https_health_check {
    # Configure https_health_check settings
  }
  # Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are ...
  icmp_health_check {

<a id="http-health-check"></a>

**HTTP Health Check**

`health_check_port` - (Optional) Health Check Port. Port used for performing health check (`Number`).

`health_check_secondary_port` - (Optional) Health Check Secondary Port. Secondary port used for performing health check. If included, both ports must be healthy for the health check to pass (`Number`).

`receive` - (Optional) Receive String. Regular expression used to match against the response to the health check's request. Mark node up upon receipt of a successful regular expression match. Uses re2 regular expression syntax (`String`).

`send` - (Optional) Send String. HTTP payload to send to the target (`String`).

<a id="https-health-check"></a>

**HTTPS Health Check**

`health_check_port` - (Optional) Health Check Port. Port used for performing health check (`Number`).

`health_check_secondary_port` - (Optional) Health Check Secondary Port. Secondary port used for performing health check. If included, both ports must be healthy for the health check to pass (`Number`).

`receive` - (Optional) Receive String. Regular expression used to match against the response to the health check's request. Mark node up upon receipt of a successful regular expression match. Uses re2 regular expression syntax (`String`).

`send` - (Optional) Send String. HTTP payload to send to the target (`String`).

<a id="tcp-health-check"></a>

**TCP Health Check**

`health_check_port` - (Optional) Health Check Port. Port used for performing health check (`Number`).

`health_check_secondary_port` - (Optional) Health Check Secondary Port. Secondary port used for performing health check. If included, both ports must be healthy for the health check to pass (`Number`).

`receive` - (Optional) Receive String. Regular expression used to match against the response to the monitor's request. Mark node up upon receipt of a successful regular expression match. Uses re2 regular expression syntax (`String`).

`send` - (Optional) Send String. Send this string to target (default empty. When send and receive are both empty, monitor just tests 3WHS) (`String`).

`health_check_port` - (Optional) Health Check Port. Port used for performing health check (`Number`).

`health_check_secondary_port` - (Optional) Health Check Secondary Port. Secondary port used for performing health check. If included, both ports must be healthy for the health check to pass (`Number`).

`receive` - (Optional) Receive Payload. Hex encoded raw bytes expected in the response (`String`).

`send` - (Optional) Send Payload. Hex encoded raw bytes sent in the request. Empty payloads imply a connect-only health check (`String`).

<a id="timeouts"></a>

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).
