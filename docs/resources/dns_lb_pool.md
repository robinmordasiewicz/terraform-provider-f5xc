# f5xc_dns_lb_pool (Resource)

Manages DNS Load Balancer Pool in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Dns Lb Pool Resource Example
# Manages DNS Load Balancer Pool in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Dns Lb Pool configuration
resource "f5xc_dns_lb_pool" "example" {
  name      = "example-dns-lb-pool"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # [OneOf: a_pool, aaaa_pool, cname_pool, mx_pool, srv_pool]...
  a_pool {
    # Configure a_pool settings
  }
  # Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are ...

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the DNSLbPool. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the DNSLbPool will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata (`Map`).

`description` - (Optional) Human readable description for the object (`String`).

`disable` - (Optional) A value of true will administratively disable the object (`Bool`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels is a user defined key value map that can be attached to resources for organization and filtering (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

-> **Only one of the following may be set:**
`a_pool` - (Optional) Pool for A Record. See [A Pool](#a-pool) below for details.
<br>`aaaa_pool` - (Optional) Pool for AAAA Record. See [Aaaa Pool](#aaaa-pool) below for details.
<br>`cname_pool` - (Optional) Pool for CNAME Record. See [Cname Pool](#cname-pool) below for details.
<br>`mx_pool` - (Optional) Pool for MX Record. See [Mx Pool](#mx-pool) below for details.
<br>`srv_pool` - (Optional) Pool for SRV Record. See [Srv Pool](#srv-pool) below for details.

`load_balancing_mode` - (Optional) LoadBalancing Algorithm. - ROUND_ROBIN: Round-Robin Round Robin will ensure random equal distribution of requests among all pool members in a pool. - RATIO_MEMBER: Ratio-Member Ratio-Member performs load balancing of requests across the pool members based on the ratio assigned to each pool member - STATIC_PERSIST: Static-Persist The Static Persist load balancing method uses the persist mask, with the source IP address of the Local Domain Name Server (LDNS), in a deterministic algorithm to send requests to a specific pool member. If the DNS resolver passes ECS (EDNS-Client-Subnet) information, then a hash of it will be used, to send the client to the same pool member - PRIORITY: Priority The Priority load balancing method returns all available endpoints in a pool with the highest priority. Pool Members have a priority value, starting from zero, where a lower value means a higher priority. Possible values are `ROUND_ROBIN`, `RATIO_MEMBER`, `STATIC_PERSIST`, `PRIORITY`. Defaults to `ROUND_ROBIN` (`String`).

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

-> **Only one of the following may be set:**
`ttl` - (Optional) TTL. Custom TTL in seconds (default 30) for responses from this pool (`Number`).
<br>`use_rrset_ttl` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).
