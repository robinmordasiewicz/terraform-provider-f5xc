# f5xc_dns_lb_pool (Resource)

Manages DNS Load Balancer Pool in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Dns Lb Pool Resource Example
# Manages DNS Load Balancer Pool in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Dns Lb Pool configuration
resource "f5xc_dns_lb_pool" "example" {
  name      = "example-dns-lb-pool"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
