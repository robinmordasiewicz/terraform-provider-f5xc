# f5xc_dns_lb_pool (Resource)

Manages DNS Load Balancer Pool in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Dns Lb Pool Resource Example
# Manages DNS Load Balancer Pool in a given namespace. If one already exist it will give a error. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Dns Lb Pool configuration
resource "f5xc_dns_lb_pool" "example" {
  name      = "example-dns-lb-pool"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # [OneOf: a_pool, aaaa_pool, cname_pool, mx_pool, srv_pool]...
  a_pool {
    # Configure a_pool settings
  }
  # Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are ...

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the DNSLbPool. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the DNSLbPool will be created.

### Optional

- `a_pool` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: a_pool, aaaa_pool, cname_pool, mx_pool, srv_pool] Pool for A Record. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--a_pool))
- `aaaa_pool` (Block, Optional) Pool for AAAA Record. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--aaaa_pool))
- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `cname_pool` (Block, Optional) Pool for CNAME Record. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--cname_pool))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `load_balancing_mode` (String) LoadBalancing Algorithm. - ROUND_ROBIN: Round-Robin Round Robin will ensure random equal distribution of requests among all pool members in a pool. - RATIO_MEMBER: Ratio-Member Ratio-Member performs load balancing of requests across the pool members based on the ratio assigned to each pool member - STATIC_PERSIST: Static-Persist The Static Persist load balancing method uses the persist mask, with the source IP address of the Local Domain Name Server (LDNS), in a deterministic algorithm to sen... Possible values are `ROUND_ROBIN`, `RATIO_MEMBER`, `STATIC_PERSIST`, `PRIORITY`.
