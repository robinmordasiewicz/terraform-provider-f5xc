# Manages a DNSZone resource in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Dns Zone configuration
resource "f5xc_dns_zone" "example" {
  name      = "example-dns-zone"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # DNS Zone configuration
  # Primary DNS zone
  primary {
    soa_record_parameters {
      refresh = 86400
      retry   = 7200
      expire  = 3600000

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).
