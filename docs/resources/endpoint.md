## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the Endpoint. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the Endpoint will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

-> **Note:** Only one of the following may be set:

    - `dns_name` - (Optional) Endpoint Name. Endpoint's IP address is discovered using DNS name resolution. The name given here is fully qualified domain name (`String`).
    - `dns_name_advanced` - (Optional) DNS Name Advanced Type. Specifies name and TTL used for DNS resolution. See [DNS Name Advanced](#dns-name-advanced) below for details.
    - `ip` - (Optional) Endpoint IP Address. Endpoint is reachable at the given IPv4/IPv6 address (`String`).
    - `service_info` - (Optional) Service Info Type. Specifies whether endpoint service is discovered by name or labels. See [Service Info](#service-info) below for details.

`health_check_port` - (Optional) Port used for health check. By default the health check port of an endpoint is the same as the endpoint’s port. This option provides an alternative health check port. Setting this with a non-zero value allows an endpoint to have different health check port (`Number`).

`port` - (Optional) Port. Endpoint service is available on this port (`Number`).

`protocol` - (Optional) Protocol. Endpoint protocol. Default is TCP. Both TCP and UDP protocols are supported (`String`).

`snat_pool` - (Optional) Snat Pool. Snat Pool configuration. See [Snat Pool](#snat-pool) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

`where` - (Optional) Network or Site Reference. NetworkSiteRefSelector defines a union of reference to site or reference to virtual_network or reference to virtual_site It is used to determine virtual network using following rules * Direct reference to virtual_network object * Site local network when refering to site object * All site local networks for sites selected by refering to virtual_site object. See [Where](#where) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

**Service Info**

`discovery_type` - (Optional) Discovery Type. Specifies whether the discovery is from Kubernetes or Consul cluster Invalid Discovery mechanism Discover from Kubernetes cluster Discover from Consul service Discover from Classic BIG-IP Clusters Discover for Third Party Application.

`service_selector` - (Optional) Label Selector. This type can be used to establish a 'selector reference' from one object(called selector) to a set of other objects(called selectees) based on the value of expresssions. A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. Label selector is immutable. expressions is a list of strings of label selection expression. Each string has ',' separated values which are 'AND' and all strings are logically 'OR'. BNF for expression string <selector-syntax> ::= <requirement> | <requirement> ',' <selector-syntax> <requirement> ::= [!] KEY [ <set-based-restriction> | <exact-match-restriction> ] <set-based-restriction> ::= '' | <inclusion-exclusion> <value-set> <inclusion-exclusion> ::= <inclusion> | <exclusion> <exclusion> ::= 'notin' <inclusion> ::= 'in' <value-set> ::= '(' <values> ')' <values> ::= VALUE | VALUE ',' <values> <exact-match-restriction> ::= ['='|'=='|'!='] VALUE.
