# f5xc_forwarding_class (Resource)

Manages a ForwardingClass resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for forwarding class is created by users in system namespace configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Forwarding Class Resource Example
# Manages a ForwardingClass resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for forwarding class is created by users in system namespace configuration.

# Basic Forwarding Class configuration
resource "f5xc_forwarding_class" "example" {
  name      = "example-forwarding-class"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the ForwardingClass. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the ForwardingClass will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `dscp` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: dscp, no_marking, tos_value] DSCP Marking setting. DSCP marking setting as per RFC 2475 (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--dscp))
- `dscp_based_queue` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: dscp_based_queue, queue_id_to_use] Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--dscp_based_queue))
- `interface_group` (String) Interface Group. Interface group, group membership by adding group label to interface Choose any of the available interfaces Choose all interfaces with label group1 Choose all interfaces with label group2 Choose all interfaces with label group3. Possible values are `ANY_AVAILABLE_INTERFACE`, `INTERFACE_GROUP1`, `INTERFACE_GROUP2`, `INTERFACE_GROUP3`.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `no_marking` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--no_marking))
- `no_policer` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: no_policer, policer] Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--no_policer))
- `policer` (Block, Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--policer))
- `queue_id_to_use` (String) Precedence Level Values. DSCP Precedence Level Values Best Effort service will get any available bandwidth DSCP Class 1 service DSCP Class 2 service DSCP Class 3 service DSCP Class 4 service Express Forwarding is used for low latency traffic Control is used for routing traffic, not recommended Link Layer traffic like LACP or keepalive, not recommended. Possible values are `DSCP_BEST_EFFORT`, `DSCP_CLASS1`, `DSCP_CLASS2`, `DSCP_CLASS3`, `DSCP_CLASS4`, `DSCP_EXPRESS_FORWARDING`, `DSCP_CONTROL_L3`, `DSCP_CONTROL_L2`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `tos_value` (Number) TOS value. Decimal value of raw 8 bit TOS. In above example DSCP 10 = Precedence Class 1 and drop precedence low

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--dscp"></a>
### Nested Schema for `dscp`

Optional:

- `drop_precedence` (String) DSCP AF Drop Precedence. DSCP Assured forwarding drop precedence DSCP Low drop precedence DSCP Low drop precedence DSCP Low drop precedence DSCP drop precedence value is taken from output of policer. Possible values are `DSCP_AF_LOW`, `DSCP_AF_MEDIUM`, `DSCP_AF_HIGH`, `DSCP_AF_POLICER`.
- `dscp_class` (String) Precedence Level Values. DSCP Precedence Level Values Best Effort service will get any available bandwidth DSCP Class 1 service DSCP Class 2 service DSCP Class 3 service DSCP Class 4 service Express Forwarding is used for low latency traffic Control is used for routing traffic, not recommended Link Layer traffic like LACP or keepalive, not recommended. Possible values are `DSCP_BEST_EFFORT`, `DSCP_CLASS1`, `DSCP_CLASS2`, `DSCP_CLASS3`, `DSCP_CLASS4`, `DSCP_EXPRESS_FORWARDING`, `DSCP_CONTROL_L3`, `DSCP_CONTROL_L2`.

### Nested Schema for `policer`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
