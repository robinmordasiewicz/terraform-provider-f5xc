# f5xc_forwarding_class (Resource)

Manages a ForwardingClass resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for forwarding class is created by users in system namespace configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Forwarding Class Resource Example
# Manages a ForwardingClass resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for forwarding class is created by users in system namespace configuration.

# Basic Forwarding Class configuration
resource "f5xc_forwarding_class" "example" {
  name      = "example-forwarding-class"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the ForwardingClass. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the ForwardingClass will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata (`Map`).

`description` - (Optional) Human readable description for the object (`String`).

`disable` - (Optional) A value of true will administratively disable the object (`Bool`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels is a user defined key value map that can be attached to resources for organization and filtering (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

-> **Only one of the following may be set:**
`dscp` - (Optional) DSCP Marking setting. DSCP marking setting as per RFC 2475. See [Dscp](#dscp) below for details.
<br>`no_marking` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).
<br>`tos_value` - (Optional) TOS value. Decimal value of raw 8 bit TOS. In above example DSCP 10 = Precedence Class 1 and drop precedence low (`Number`).

-> **Only one of the following may be set:**
`dscp_based_queue` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).
<br>`queue_id_to_use` - (Optional) Precedence Level Values. DSCP Precedence Level Values Best Effort service will get any available bandwidth DSCP Class 1 service DSCP Class 2 service DSCP Class 3 service DSCP Class 4 service Express Forwarding is used for low latency traffic Control is used for routing traffic, not recommended Link Layer traffic like LACP or keepalive, not recommended. Possible values are `DSCP_BEST_EFFORT`, `DSCP_CLASS1`, `DSCP_CLASS2`, `DSCP_CLASS3`, `DSCP_CLASS4`, `DSCP_EXPRESS_FORWARDING`, `DSCP_CONTROL_L3`, `DSCP_CONTROL_L2`. Defaults to `DSCP_BEST_EFFORT` (`String`).

`interface_group` - (Optional) Interface Group. Interface group, group membership by adding group label to interface Choose any of the available interfaces Choose all interfaces with label group1 Choose all interfaces with label group2 Choose all interfaces with label group3. Possible values are `ANY_AVAILABLE_INTERFACE`, `INTERFACE_GROUP1`, `INTERFACE_GROUP2`, `INTERFACE_GROUP3`. Defaults to `ANY_AVAILABLE_INTERFACE` (`String`).

-> **Only one of the following may be set:**
`no_policer` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).
<br>`policer` - (Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name. See [Policer](#policer) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

**Policer**

`name` - (Optional) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name (`String`).

`namespace` - (Optional) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace (`String`).
