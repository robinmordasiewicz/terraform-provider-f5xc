## Example Usage

```terraform
# Gcp Vpc Site Resource Example
# Manages a GCPVPCSite resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for deploying F5 sites within Google Cloud VPC environments.

# Basic Gcp Vpc Site configuration
resource "f5xc_gcp_vpc_site" "example" {
  name      = "example-gcp-vpc-site"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # GCP VPC Site configuration
  gcp_region = "us-west1"

  # GCP credentials reference
  cloud_credentials {
    name      = "gcp-credentials"
    namespace = "system"
  }

  # Instance type
  instance_type = "n1-standard-4"

  # Ingress/Egress gateway
  ingress_egress_gw {
    gcp_certified_hw = "gcp-byol-multi-nic-voltmesh"
    node_number      = 1
    inside_network {
      new_network {
        name = "inside-network"
      }
    }
    outside_network {
      new_network {
        name = "outside-network"
      }
    }
    inside_subnet {
      new_subnet {
        subnet_name  = "inside-subnet"
        primary_ipv4 = "10.0.1.0/24"
      }
    }
    outside_subnet {
      new_subnet {
        subnet_name  = "outside-subnet"
        primary_ipv4 = "10.0.2.0/24"
      }
    }
  }

  # No worker nodes by default
  no_worker_nodes {}
}

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the GCPVPCSite. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the GCPVPCSite will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`address` - (Optional) Geographical Address. Site's geographical address that can be used to determine its latitude and longitude (`String`).

`admin_password` - (Optional) Secret. SecretType is used in an object to indicate a sensitive/confidential field. See [Admin Password](./gcp_vpc_site_nested_blocks#admin-password) for details.

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "block_all_services, blocked_services, default_blocked_services" must be set.

`block_all_services` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`blocked_services` - (Optional) Disable Node Local Services. Disable node local services on this site. Note: The chosen services will get disabled on all nodes in the site. See [Blocked Services](./gcp_vpc_site_nested_blocks#blocked-services) for details.

`default_blocked_services` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`cloud_credentials` - (Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name. See [Cloud Credentials](./gcp_vpc_site_nested_blocks#cloud-credentials) for details.

`coordinates` - (Optional) Site Coordinates. Coordinates of the site which provides the site physical location. See [Coordinates](./gcp_vpc_site_nested_blocks#coordinates) for details.

`custom_dns` - (Optional) Custom DNS. Custom DNS is the configured for specify CE site. See [Custom DNS](./gcp_vpc_site_nested_blocks#custom-dns) for details.

`disk_size` - (Optional) Cloud Disk Size. Disk size to be used for this instance in GiB. 80 is 80 GiB (`Number`).

`gcp_labels` - (Optional) GCP Labels. GCP Label is a label consisting of a user-defined key and value. It helps to manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources in GCP console (`Block`).

`gcp_region` - (Optional) GCP Region. Name for GCP Region (`String`).

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "ingress_egress_gw, ingress_gw, voltstack_cluster" must be set.

`ingress_egress_gw` - (Optional) GCP Ingress/Egress Gateway. Two interface GCP ingress/egress site. See [Ingress Egress Gw](./gcp_vpc_site_nested_blocks#ingress-egress-gw) for details.

`ingress_gw` - (Optional) GCP Ingress Gateway. Single interface GCP ingress site (`Block`).

`voltstack_cluster` - (Optional) GCP App Stack Cluster. App Stack cluster of single interface GCP site (`Block`).

`instance_type` - (Optional) GCP Instance Type for Node. Select Instance size based on performance needed (`String`).

`kubernetes_upgrade_drain` - (Optional) Node by Node Upgrade. Specify how worker nodes within a site will be upgraded (`Block`).

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "log_receiver, logs_streaming_disabled" must be set.

`log_receiver` - (Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (`Block`).

`logs_streaming_disabled` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`offline_survivability_mode` - (Optional) Offline Survivability Mode. Offline Survivability allows the Site to continue functioning normally without traffic loss during periods of connectivity loss to the Regional Edge (RE) or the Global Controller (GC). When this feature is enabled, a site can continue to function as is with existing configuration for upto 7 days, even when the site is offline. The certificates needed to keep the services running on this site are signed using a local CA. Secrets would also be cached locally to handle the connectivity loss. When the mode is toggled, services will restart and traffic disruption will be seen (`Block`).

`os` - (Optional) Operating System Version. Select the F5XC Operating System Version for the site. By default, latest available OS Version will be used. Refer to release notes to find required released OS versions (`Block`).

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "private_connect_disabled, private_connectivity" must be set.

`private_connect_disabled` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`private_connectivity` - (Optional) Private Connect Configuration. Private Connect Configuration (`Block`).

`ssh_key` - (Optional) Public SSH key. Public SSH key for accessing the site (`String`).

`sw` - (Optional) F5XC Software Version. Select the F5XC Software Version for the site. By default, latest available F5XC Software Version will be used. Refer to release notes to find required released SW versions (`Block`).

`timeouts` - (Optional) (`Block`).

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).
