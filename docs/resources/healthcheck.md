# f5xc_healthcheck (Resource)

Manages a Healthcheck resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given endpoint is healthy. single healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many cluster objects. configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Healthcheck Resource Example
# Manages a Healthcheck resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given endpoint is healthy. single healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many cluster objects. configuration.

# Basic Healthcheck configuration
resource "f5xc_healthcheck" "example" {
  name      = "example-healthcheck"
  namespace = "staging"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  // One of the arguments from this list "http_health_check tcp_health_check udp_icmp_health_check" must be set

  http_health_check {
    // One of the arguments from this list "host_header use_origin_server_name" must be set

    use_origin_server_name {}

    path                  = "/health"
    use_http2             = false
    expected_status_codes = ["200"]

    // One of the arguments from this list "headers request_headers_to_remove" must be set

    headers = {
      "x-health-check" = "true"
    }
  }

  healthy_threshold   = 3
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  interval            = 15
  timeout             = 5
}

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

<a id="name"></a>&#x2022; [`name`](#name) - Required String<br>Name of the Healthcheck. Must be unique within the namespace

<a id="namespace"></a>&#x2022; [`namespace`](#namespace) - Required String<br>Namespace where the Healthcheck will be created

<a id="annotations"></a>&#x2022; [`annotations`](#annotations) - Optional Map<br>Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata

<a id="description"></a>&#x2022; [`description`](#description) - Optional String<br>Human readable description for the object

<a id="disable"></a>&#x2022; [`disable`](#disable) - Optional Bool<br>A value of true will administratively disable the object

<a id="labels"></a>&#x2022; [`labels`](#labels) - Optional Map<br>Labels is a user defined key value map that can be attached to resources for organization and filtering

### Spec Argument Reference

<a id="healthy-threshold"></a>&#x2022; [`healthy_threshold`](#healthy-threshold) - Optional Number<br>Number of successful responses before declaring healthy. In other words, this is the number of healthy health checks required before a host is marked healthy. Note that during startup, only a single successful health check is required to mark a host healthy

-> **One of the following:**
&#x2022; <a id="http-health-check"></a>[`http_health_check`](#http-health-check) - Optional Block<br>Healthy if 'GET' method on URL 'HTTP(s)://`<host>`/`<path>`' with optional '`<header>`' returns success. 'host' is not used for DNS resolution. It is used as HTTP Header in the request<br>See [HTTP Health Check](#http-health-check) below for details.
<br><br>&#x2022; <a id="tcp-health-check"></a>[`tcp_health_check`](#tcp-health-check) - Optional Block<br>Healthy if TCP connection is successful and response payload matches `<expected_response>`<br>See [TCP Health Check](#tcp-health-check) below for details.
<br><br>&#x2022; <a id="udp-icmp-health-check"></a>[`udp_icmp_health_check`](#udp-icmp-health-check) - Optional Block<br>Can be used for messages where no values are needed

<a id="interval"></a>&#x2022; [`interval`](#interval) - Optional Number<br>Time interval in seconds between two healthcheck requests

<a id="jitter-percent"></a>&#x2022; [`jitter_percent`](#jitter-percent) - Optional Number  Defaults to `0`<br>Add a random amount of time as a percent value to the interval between successive healthcheck requests

<a id="timeout"></a>&#x2022; [`timeout`](#timeout) - Optional Number<br>Timeout in seconds to wait for successful response. In other words, it is the time to wait for a health check response. If the timeout is reached the health check attempt will be considered a failure

<a id="timeouts"></a>&#x2022; [`timeouts`](#timeouts) - Optional Block<br>See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

<a id="unhealthy-threshold"></a>&#x2022; [`unhealthy_threshold`](#unhealthy-threshold) - Optional Number<br>Number of failed responses before declaring unhealthy. In other words, this is the number of unhealthy health checks required before a host is marked unhealthy. Note that for HTTP health checking if a host responds with 503 this threshold is ignored and the host is considered unhealthy immediately

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

<a id="id"></a>&#x2022; [`id`](#id) - Optional String<br>Unique identifier for the resource
