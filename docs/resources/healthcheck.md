# f5xc_healthcheck (Resource)

Manages a Healthcheck resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given endpoint is healthy. single healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many cluster objects. configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Healthcheck Resource Example
# Manages a Healthcheck resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given endpoint is healthy. single healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many cluster objects. configuration.

# Basic Healthcheck configuration
resource "f5xc_healthcheck" "example" {
  name      = "example-healthcheck"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Health Check specific configuration
  http_health_check {
    use_origin_server_name {}
    path                  = "/health"
    use_http2             = false
    expected_status_codes = ["200"]
  }

  healthy_threshold   = 3
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  interval            = 15
  timeout             = 5
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the Healthcheck. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the Healthcheck will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `healthy_threshold` (Number) Healthy Threshold. Number of successful responses before declaring healthy. In other words, this is the number of healthy health checks required before a host is marked healthy. Note that during startup, only a single successful health check is required to mark a host healthy.
- `http_health_check` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: http_health_check, tcp_health_check, udp_icmp_health_check] HTTP Health Check. Healthy if 'get' method on URL 'http(s)://<host>/<path>' with optional '<header>' returns success. 'host' is not used for DNS resolution. It is used as HTTP Header in the request. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--http_health_check))
- `interval` (Number) Interval. Time interval in seconds between two healthcheck requests.
- `jitter_percent` (Number) Jitter Percent. Add a random amount of time as a percent value to the interval between successive healthcheck requests.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `tcp_health_check` (Block, Optional) TCP Health Check. Healthy if TCP connection is successful and response payload matches <expected_response> (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tcp_health_check))
- `timeout` (Number) Timeout. Timeout in seconds to wait for successful response. In other words, it is the time to wait for a health check response. If the timeout is reached the health check attempt will be considered a failure.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `udp_icmp_health_check` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--udp_icmp_health_check))
- `unhealthy_threshold` (Number) Unhealthy Threshold. Number of failed responses before declaring unhealthy. In other words, this is the number of unhealthy health checks required before a host is marked unhealthy. Note that for http health checking if a host responds with 503 this threshold is ignored and the host is considered unhealthy immediately.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

### Nested Schema for `http_health_check`

Optional:

- `expected_status_codes` (List of String) Expected Status Codes. Specifies a list of HTTP response status codes considered healthy. To treat default HTTP expected status code 200 as healthy, user has to configure it explicitly. This is a list of strings, each of which is single HTTP status code or a range with start and end values separated by '-'.
- `headers` (Block, Optional) Request Headers to Add. Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be added to each request that is sent to the health checked cluster. This is a list of key-value pairs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--http_health_check--headers))
- `host_header` (String) Host Header Value. The value of the host header.
- `path` (String) Path. Specifies the HTTP path that will be requested during health checking.
- `request_headers_to_remove` (List of String) Request Headers to Remove. Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be removed from each request that is sent to the health checked cluster. This is a list of keys of headers.
- `use_http2` (Boolean) Use HTTP2. If set, health checks will be made using http/2.
- `use_origin_server_name` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--http_health_check--use_origin_server_name))

<a id="nestedblock--tcp_health_check"></a>
### Nested Schema for `tcp_health_check`

Optional:

- `expected_response` (String) Expected Response. raw bytes expected in the request. Describes the encoding of the payload bytes in the payload. Hex encoded payload.
- `send_payload` (String) Send Payload. raw bytes sent in the request. Empty payloads imply a connect-only health check. Describes the encoding of the payload bytes in the payload. Hex encoded payload.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
