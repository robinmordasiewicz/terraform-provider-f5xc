# f5xc_healthcheck (Resource)

Manages a Healthcheck resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given endpoint is healthy. single healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many cluster objects. configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Healthcheck Resource Example
# Manages a Healthcheck resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given endpoint is healthy. single healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many cluster objects. configuration.

# Basic Healthcheck configuration
resource "f5xc_healthcheck" "example" {
  name      = "example-healthcheck"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Health Check specific configuration
  http_health_check {
    use_origin_server_name {}
    path                  = "/health"
    use_http2             = false
    expected_status_codes = ["200"]
  }

  healthy_threshold   = 3
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  interval            = 15
  timeout             = 5
}
```

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the Healthcheck. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the Healthcheck will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`healthy_threshold` - (Optional) Healthy Threshold. Number of successful responses before declaring healthy. In other words, this is the number of healthy health checks required before a host is marked healthy. Note that during startup, only a single successful health check is required to mark a host healthy (`Number`).

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "http_health_check, tcp_health_check, udp_icmp_health_check" must be set.

`http_health_check` - (Optional) HTTP Health Check. Healthy if 'get' method on URL 'HTTP(s)://<host>/<path>' with optional '<header>' returns success. 'host' is not used for DNS resolution. It is used as HTTP Header in the request. See [HTTP Health Check](#http-health-check) below for details.

`tcp_health_check` - (Optional) TCP Health Check. Healthy if TCP connection is successful and response payload matches <expected_response>. See [TCP Health Check](#tcp-health-check) below for details.

`udp_icmp_health_check` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed. See [UDP ICMP Health Check](#udp-icmp-health-check) below for details.

`interval` - (Optional) Interval. Time interval in seconds between two healthcheck requests (`Number`).

`jitter_percent` - (Optional) Jitter Percent. Add a random amount of time as a percent value to the interval between successive healthcheck requests (`Number`).

`timeout` - (Optional) Timeout. Timeout in seconds to wait for successful response. In other words, it is the time to wait for a health check response. If the timeout is reached the health check attempt will be considered a failure (`Number`).

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

`unhealthy_threshold` - (Optional) Unhealthy Threshold. Number of failed responses before declaring unhealthy. In other words, this is the number of unhealthy health checks required before a host is marked unhealthy. Note that for HTTP health checking if a host responds with 503 this threshold is ignored and the host is considered unhealthy immediately (`Number`).

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).
