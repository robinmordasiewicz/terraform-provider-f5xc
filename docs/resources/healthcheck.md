# f5xc_healthcheck (Resource)

Healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given Endpoint is healthy. Single Healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many Cluster objects.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Healthcheck Resource Example
# Healthcheck object defines method to determine if the given Endpoint is healthy. Single Healthcheck object can be referred to by one or many Cluster objects.

# Basic Healthcheck configuration
resource "f5xc_healthcheck" "example" {
  name      = "my-healthcheck"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Health Check specific configuration
  http_health_check {
    use_origin_server_name {}
    path                   = "/health"
    use_http2              = false
    expected_status_codes  = ["200"]
  }

  healthy_threshold   = 3
  unhealthy_threshold = 3
  interval            = 15
  timeout             = 5
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

`name` - (Required) Name of the Healthcheck. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the Healthcheck will be created (`String`).


The following arguments are optional:

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`healthy_threshold` - (Optional) Healthy Threshold. Number of successful responses before declaring healthy. In other words, this is the number of healthy health checks required before a host is marked healthy (`Number`).

`http_health_check` - (Optional) HTTP Health Check. Healthy if 'get' method on URL 'http(s)://<host>/<path>' with optional '<header>' returns success. 'host' is not used for DNS resolution. It is used as HTTP Header in the request. See [Http Health Check](#http-health-check) below for details.

`interval` - (Optional) Interval. Time interval in seconds between two healthcheck requests. Required: YES ves.io.schema.rules.message.required: true ves.io.schema.rules.uint32.gte: 1 ves.io.schema.rules.uint32.lte: 600 (`Number`).

`jitter_percent` - (Optional) Jitter Percent. Add a random amount of time as a percent value to the interval between successive healthcheck requests. ves.io.schema.rules.uint32.ranges: 0,10-50 (`Number`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`tcp_health_check` - (Optional) TCP Health Check. Healthy if TCP connection is successful and response payload matches <expected_response>. See [Tcp Health Check](#tcp-health-check) below for details.

`timeout` - (Optional) Timeout. Timeout in seconds to wait for successful response. In other words, it is the time to wait for a health check response (`Number`).

`udp_icmp_health_check` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed. See [Udp Icmp Health Check](#udp-icmp-health-check) below for details.

`unhealthy_threshold` - (Optional) Unhealthy Threshold. Number of failed responses before declaring unhealthy. In other words, this is the number of unhealthy health checks required before a host is marked unhealthy (`Number`).


### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

### Http Health Check

`expected_status_codes` - (Optional) Expected Status Codes. Specifies a list of HTTP response status codes considered healthy. To treat default HTTP expected status code 200 as healthy, user has to configure it explicitly (`List`).

`headers` - (Optional) Request Headers to Add. Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be added to each request that is sent to the health checked cluster. This is a list of key-value pairs. ves.io.schema.rules.map. See [Headers](#nestedblock--http_health_check--headers) below.

`host_header` - (Optional) Host Header Value. Exclusive with [use_origin_server_name] The value of the host header. ves.io.schema.rules.string.hostport: true ves.io.schema.rules.string.max_len: 262 (`String`).

`path` - (Optional) Path. Specifies the HTTP path that will be requested during health checking. Required: YES ves.io.schema.rules.message.required: true ves.io.schema.rules.string.http_path: true ves.io.schema.rules (`String`).

`request_headers_to_remove` - (Optional) Request Headers to Remove. Specifies a list of HTTP headers that should be removed from each request that is sent to the health checked cluster. This is a list of keys of headers. ves.io.schema.rules (`List`).

`use_http2` - (Optional) Use HTTP2. If set, health checks will be made using http/2 (`Bool`).

`use_origin_server_name` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed. See [Use Origin Server Name](#nestedblock--http_health_check--use_origin_server_name) below.

### Tcp Health Check

`expected_response` - (Optional) Expected Response. raw bytes expected in the request. Describes the encoding of the payload bytes in the payload. Hex encoded payload. ves.io.schema.rules.string.hex: true ves.io.schema.rules.string (`String`).

`send_payload` - (Optional) Send Payload. raw bytes sent in the request. Empty payloads imply a connect-only health check. Describes the encoding of the payload bytes in the payload. Hex encoded payload. ves.io.schema.rules (`String`).
