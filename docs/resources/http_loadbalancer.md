`http_idle_timeout` - (Optional) HTTP Idle Timeout. The idle timeout for upstream connection pool connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. When the idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive. This is specified in milliseconds. The default value is 5 minutes (`Number`).

`connection_limit` - (Optional) Connection Limit. The maximum number of connections that loadbalancer will establish to all hosts in an upstream cluster. In practice this is only applicable to TCP and HTTP/1.1 clusters since HTTP/2 uses a single connection to each host. Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if number of connections reach connection limit (`Number`).

`max_requests` - (Optional) Maximum Request Count. The maximum number of requests that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time. In practice this is applicable to HTTP/2 clusters since HTTP/1.1 clusters are governed by the maximum connections (connection_limit). Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if requests exceed this count (`Number`).

`pending_requests` - (Optional) Pending Requests. The maximum number of requests that will be queued while waiting for a ready connection pool connection. Since HTTP/2 requests are sent over a single connection, this circuit breaker only comes into play as the initial connection is created, as requests will be multiplexed immediately afterwards. For HTTP/1.1, requests are added to the list of pending requests whenever there aren’t enough upstream connections available to immediately dispatch the request, so this circuit b.. (`Number`).

`priority` - (Optional) Routing Priority. Priority routing for each request. Different connection pools are used based on the priority selected for the request. Also, circuit-breaker configuration at destination cluster is chosen based on selected priority. Default routing mechanism High-Priority routing mechanism. Possible values are `DEFAULT`, `HIGH`. Defaults to `DEFAULT` (`String`).

`retries` - (Optional) Retry Count. The maximum number of retries that can be outstanding to all hosts in a cluster at any given time. Remove endpoint out of load balancing decision, if retries for request exceed this count (`Number`).

`consecutive_5xx` - (Optional) Consecutive 5xx Count. If an upstream endpoint returns some number of consecutive 5xx, it will be ejected. Note that in this case a 5xx means an actual 5xx respond code, or an event that would cause the HTTP router to return one on the upstream’s behalf(reset, connection failure, etc.) consecutive_5xx indicates the number of consecutive 5xx responses required before a consecutive 5xx ejection occurs. Defaults to 5 (`Number`).

`consecutive_gateway_failure` - (Optional) Consecutive Gateway Failure. If an upstream endpoint returns some number of consecutive “gateway errors” (502, 503 or 504 status code), it will be ejected. Note that this includes events that would cause the HTTP router to return one of these status codes on the upstream’s behalf (reset, connection failure, etc.). consecutive_gateway_failure indicates the number of consecutive gateway failures before a consecutive gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5 (`Number`).

`interval` - (Optional) Interval. The time interval between ejection analysis sweeps. This can result in both new ejections as well as endpoints being returned to service. Defaults to 10000ms or 10s. Specified in milliseconds (`Number`).
