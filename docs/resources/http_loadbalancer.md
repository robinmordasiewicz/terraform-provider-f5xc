`pending_requests` - (Optional) Pending Requests. The maximum number of requests that will be queued while waiting for a ready connection pool connection. Since HTTP/2 requests are sent over a single connection, this circuit breaker only comes into play as the initial connection is created, as requests will be multiplexed immediately afterwards.

### Default Pool Advanced Options Outlier Detection

`base_ejection_time` - (Optional) Base Ejection Time. The base time that a host is ejected for. The real time is equal to the base time multiplied by the number of times the host has been ejected. This causes hosts to get ejected for longer periods if they continue to fail. Defaults to 30000ms or 30s. Specified in milliseconds (`Number`).

`consecutive_5xx` - (Optional) Consecutive 5xx Count. If an upstream endpoint returns some number of consecutive 5xx, it will be ejected. Note that in this case a 5xx means an actual 5xx respond code, or an event that would cause the HTTP router to return one on the upstream’s behalf(reset, connection failure, etc.) consecutive_5xx indicates the number of consecutive 5xx responses required before a consecutive 5xx ejection occurs. Defaults to 5 (`Number`).

`consecutive_gateway_failure` - (Optional) Consecutive Gateway Failure. If an upstream endpoint returns some number of consecutive “gateway errors” (502, 503 or 504 status code), it will be ejected. Note that this includes events that would cause the HTTP router to return one of these status codes on the upstream’s behalf (reset, connection failure, etc.). consecutive_gateway_failure indicates the number of consecutive gateway failures before a consecutive gateway failure ejection occurs. Defaults to 5 (`Number`).

`interval` - (Optional) Interval. The time interval between ejection analysis sweeps. This can result in both new ejections as well as endpoints being returned to service. Defaults to 10000ms or 10s. Specified in milliseconds (`Number`).

`max_ejection_percent` - (Optional) Max Ejection Percentage. The maximum % of an upstream cluster that can be ejected due to outlier detection. Defaults to 10% but will eject at least one host regardless of the value (`Number`).

If a request API matches a challenge rule, the configured challenge is enfor. See [Spec](#policy-based-challenge-rule-list-rules-spec) below.
