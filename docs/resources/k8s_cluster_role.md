# f5xc_k8s_cluster_role (Resource)

Manages k8s_cluster_role will create the object in the storage backend for namespace metadata.namespace in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# K8s Cluster Role Resource Example
# Manages k8s_cluster_role will create the object in the storage backend for namespace metadata.namespace in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic K8s Cluster Role configuration
resource "f5xc_k8s_cluster_role" "example" {
  name      = "example-k8s-cluster-role"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # [OneOf: k8s_cluster_role_selector, policy_rule_list, yaml...
  k8s_cluster_role_selector {
    # Configure k8s_cluster_role_selector settings
  }
  # Policy Rule List. List of rules for role permissions
  policy_rule_list {
    # Configure policy_rule_list settings
  }
  # Policy Rules. List of rules for role permissions
  policy_rule {
    # Configure policy_rule settings
  }
}

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the K8SClusterRole. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the K8SClusterRole will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata (`Map`).

`description` - (Optional) Human readable description for the object (`String`).

`disable` - (Optional) A value of true will administratively disable the object (`Bool`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels is a user defined key value map that can be attached to resources for organization and filtering (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

-> **Only one of the following may be set:**
`k8s_cluster_role_selector` - (Optional) Label Selector. This type can be used to establish a 'selector reference' from one object(called selector) to a set of other objects(called selectees) based on the value of expresssions. A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. Label selector is immutable. expressions is a list of strings of label selection expression. Each string has ',' separated values which are 'AND' and all strings are logically 'OR'. BNF for expression string <selector-syntax> ::= <requirement> | <requirement> ',' <selector-syntax> <requirement> ::= [!] KEY [ <set-based-restriction> | <exact-match-restriction> ] <set-based-restriction> ::= '' | <inclusion-exclusion> <value-set> <inclusion-exclusion> ::= <inclusion> | <exclusion> <exclusion> ::= 'notin' <inclusion> ::= 'in' <value-set> ::= '(' <values> ')' <values> ::= VALUE | VALUE ',' <values> <exact-match-restriction> ::= ['='|'=='|'!='] VALUE. See [K8s Cluster Role Selector](#k8s-cluster-role-selector) below for details.
<br>`policy_rule_list` - (Optional) Policy Rule List. List of rules for role permissions. See [Policy Rule List](#policy-rule-list) below for details.
<br>`yaml` - (Optional) K8s YAML. K8s YAML for ClusterRole (`String`).

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="k8s-cluster-role-selector"></a>

**K8s Cluster Role Selector**

`expressions` - (Optional) Selector Expression. expressions contains the kubernetes style label expression for selections (`List`).

<a id="policy-rule-list"></a>

**Policy Rule List**

`policy_rule` - (Optional) Policy Rules. List of rules for role permissions. See [Policy Rule](#policy-rule-list-policy-rule) below.

<a id="policy-rule-list-policy-rule"></a>

**Policy Rule List Policy Rule**

`non_resource_url_list` - (Optional) List of Non Resource URL(s). permissions for URL(s) that do not represent K8s resource. See [Non Resource URL List](#policy-rule-list-policy-rule-non-resource-url-list) below.

`resource_list` - (Optional) Resource List. List of resources in terms of API groups/resource types/resource instances and verbs allowed. See [Resource List](#policy-rule-list-policy-rule-resource-list) below.

<a id="policy-rule-list-policy-rule-non-resource-url-list"></a>

**Policy Rule List Policy Rule Non Resource URL List**

`urls` - (Optional) Non Resource URL(s). allowed URL(s) that do not represent any K8s resource. URL can be suffix or regex (`List`).

`verbs` - (Optional) Allowed Verbs. Allowed list of verbs(operations) on resources. Use VerbAll for all operations (`List`).

<a id="policy-rule-list-policy-rule-resource-list"></a>

**Policy Rule List Policy Rule Resource List**

`api_groups` - (Optional) API Groups. Allowed list of API group that contains resources, all resources of a given API group (`List`).

`resource_instances` - (Optional) Resource Instances. Allowed list of resource instances within the resource types (`List`).

`resource_types` - (Optional) Resource Types. Allowed list of resource types within the API groups (`List`).

`verbs` - (Optional) Allowed Verbs. Allowed list of verbs(operations) on resources. Use * for all operations (`List`).

<a id="timeouts"></a>

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
