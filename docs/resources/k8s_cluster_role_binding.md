## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the K8SClusterRoleBinding. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the K8SClusterRoleBinding will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `k8s_cluster_role` (Block, Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--k8s_cluster_role))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `subjects` (Block List) Subjects. List of subjects (user, group or service account) to which this role is bound (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--subjects))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--k8s_cluster_role"></a>
### Nested Schema for `k8s_cluster_role`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.


<a id="nestedblock--subjects"></a>
### Nested Schema for `subjects`

Optional:

- `group` (String) Group. Group id of the user group
- `service_account` (Block, Optional) ServiceAccountType. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--subjects--service_account))
- `user` (String) User. User id of the user

<a id="nestedblock--subjects--service_account"></a>
### Nested Schema for `subjects.service_account`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name. Name of the service account
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. Namespace of the service account



<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
