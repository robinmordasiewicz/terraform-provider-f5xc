## Example Usage

```terraform
# Log Receiver Resource Example
# Manages a LogReceiver resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for log collection and forwarding configuration.

# Basic Log Receiver configuration
resource "f5xc_log_receiver" "example" {
  name      = "example-log-receiver"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Log Receiver configuration
  # HTTP receiver example
  http_receiver {
    uri = "`https://logs.example.com/ingest"`
    batch {
      max_bytes       = 1048576
      max_events      = 100
      timeout_seconds = 5
