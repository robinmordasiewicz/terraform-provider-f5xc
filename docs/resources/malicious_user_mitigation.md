# f5xc_malicious_user_mitigation (Resource)

Manages malicious_user_mitigation creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Malicious User Mitigation Resource Example
# Manages malicious_user_mitigation creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Malicious User Mitigation configuration
resource "f5xc_malicious_user_mitigation" "example" {
  name      = "example-malicious-user-mitigation"
  namespace = "shared"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Malicious User Mitigation configuration
  # Detection rules
  rules {
    threat_level = "HIGH"
    mitigation_action {
      block {
        body   = "Access denied"
        status = "403"
      }
    }

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the MaliciousUserMitigation. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the MaliciousUserMitigation will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata (`Map`).

`description` - (Optional) Human readable description for the object (`String`).

`disable` - (Optional) A value of true will administratively disable the object (`Bool`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels is a user defined key value map that can be attached to resources for organization and filtering (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`mitigation_type` - (Optional) Malicious User Mitigation Settings. Settings that specify the actions to be taken when malicious users are determined to be at different threat levels. User's activity is monitored and continuously analyzed for malicious behavior. From this analysis, a threat-level is assigned to each user. The settings defined in malicious user mitigation specify what mitigation actions to take for user determined to be at different threat levels. See [Mitigation Type](#mitigation-type) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="mitigation-type"></a>

**Mitigation Type**

`rules` - (Optional) Rules. Define the threat levels and the corresponding mitigation actions to be taken. See [Rules](#mitigation-type-rules) below.

<a id="mitigation-type-rules"></a>

**Mitigation Type Rules**

`mitigation_action` - (Optional) Malicious User Mitigation Action. Supported actions that can be taken to mitigate malicious activity from a user. See [Mitigation Action](#mitigation-type-rules-mitigation-action) below.

`threat_level` - (Optional) Malicious User Threat Level. Threat level estimated for each user based on the user's activity and reputation. See [Threat Level](#mitigation-type-rules-threat-level) below.

<a id="mitigation-type-rules-mitigation-action"></a>

**Mitigation Type Rules Mitigation Action**

`block_temporarily` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`captcha_challenge` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`javascript_challenge` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

<a id="mitigation-type-rules-threat-level"></a>

**Mitigation Type Rules Threat Level**

`high` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`low` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`medium` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

<a id="timeouts"></a>

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs (`String`).

`read` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled (`String`).

`update` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).
