## Example Usage

```terraform
# Malicious User Mitigation Resource Example
# Manages malicious_user_mitigation creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Malicious User Mitigation configuration
resource "f5xc_malicious_user_mitigation" "example" {
  name      = "example-malicious-user-mitigation"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Malicious User Mitigation configuration
  # Detection rules
  rules {
    threat_level = "HIGH"
    mitigation_action {
      block {

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the MaliciousUserMitigation. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the MaliciousUserMitigation will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`mitigation_type` - (Optional) Malicious User Mitigation Settings. Settings that specify the actions to be taken when malicious users are determined to be at different threat levels. User's activity is monitored and continuously analyzed for malicious behavior. From this analysis, a threat-level is assigned to each user. The settings defined in malicious user mitigation specify what mitigation actions to take for user determined to be at different threat levels. See [Mitigation Type](#mitigation-type) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

### Mitigation Type

`rules` - (Optional) Rules. Define the threat levels and the corresponding mitigation actions to be taken. See [Rules](#mitigation-type-rules) below.

<a id="mitigation-type-rules"></a>

### Mitigation Type Rules

`mitigation_action` - (Optional) Malicious User Mitigation Action. Supported actions that can be taken to mitigate malicious activity from a user. See [Mitigation Action](#mitigation-type-rules-mitigation-action) below.

`threat_level` - (Optional) Malicious User Threat Level. Threat level estimated for each user based on the user's activity and reputation. See [Threat Level](#mitigation-type-rules-threat-level) below.
