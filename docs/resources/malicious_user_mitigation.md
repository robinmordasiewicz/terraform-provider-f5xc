## Example Usage

```terraform
# Malicious User Mitigation Resource Example
# Manages malicious_user_mitigation creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Malicious User Mitigation configuration
resource "f5xc_malicious_user_mitigation" "example" {
  name      = "example-malicious-user-mitigation"
  namespace = "shared"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Malicious User Mitigation configuration
  # Detection rules
  rules {
    threat_level = "HIGH"
    mitigation_action {
      block {
        body   = "Access denied"

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

&#x2022; `name` - Required String<br>Name of the MaliciousUserMitigation. Must be unique within the namespace

&#x2022; `namespace` - Required String<br>Namespace where the MaliciousUserMitigation will be created

&#x2022; `annotations` - Optional Map<br>Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata

&#x2022; `description` - Optional String<br>Human readable description for the object

&#x2022; `disable` - Optional Bool<br>A value of true will administratively disable the object

&#x2022; `labels` - Optional Map<br>Labels is a user defined key value map that can be attached to resources for organization and filtering

### Spec Argument Reference

&#x2022; `mitigation_type` - Optional Block<br>Malicious User Mitigation Settings. Settings that specify the actions to be taken when malicious users are determined to be at different threat levels. User's activity is monitored and continuously analyzed for malicious behavior. From this analysis, a threat-level is assigned to each user. The settings defined in malicious user mitigation specify what mitigation actions to take for user determined to be at different threat levels<br>See [Mitigation Type](#mitigation-type) below for details.

&#x2022; `timeouts` - Optional Block<br>See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference
