### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `groups` (Block List) Group Mapping. List of local user group association to user groups in the managed tenant specified in the tenant_choice. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--groups))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.

### Nested Schema for `groups`

Optional:

- `group` (Block, Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--groups--group))
- `managed_tenant_groups` (List of String) Managed Tenant Groups. List of group names in managed tenant (MT). Note - To properly establish access, admin of managed tenant need to create corresponding Allowed Tenant configuration object with access to use same group names.
