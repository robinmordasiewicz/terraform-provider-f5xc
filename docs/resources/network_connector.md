# f5xc_network_connector (Resource)

Manages a NetworkConnector resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for network connector is created by users in system namespace configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Network Connector Resource Example
# Manages a NetworkConnector resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for network connector is created by users in system namespace configuration.

# Basic Network Connector configuration
resource "f5xc_network_connector" "example" {
  name      = "example-network-connector"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Network Connector configuration
  # Direct connection
  sli_to_global_dr {
    global_vn {
      name      = "global-network"
      namespace = "system"
    }
  }

  # Disable forward proxy
  disable_forward_proxy {}
}

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the NetworkConnector. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the NetworkConnector will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "disable_forward_proxy, enable_forward_proxy" must be set.

`disable_forward_proxy` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`enable_forward_proxy` - (Optional) Forward Proxy Configuration. Fine tune forward proxy behavior Few configurations allowed are White listed ports and IP prefixes: Forward proxy does application protocol detection and server name(SNI) detection by peeking into the traffic on the incoming downstream connection. Few protocols doesn't have client sending the first data. In such cases, protocol and SNI detection fails. This configuration allows, skipping protocol and SNI detection for whitelisted IP-prefix-list and ports connection_timeout: The timeout for new network connections to upstream server. max_connect_attempts: Maximum number of attempts made to make new network connection to upstream server. See [Enable Forward Proxy](#enable-forward-proxy) below for details.

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "sli_to_global_dr, sli_to_slo_snat, slo_to_global_dr" must be set.

`sli_to_global_dr` - (Optional) Global Network. Global network reference for direct connection. See [Sli To Global DR](#sli-to-global-dr) below for details.
