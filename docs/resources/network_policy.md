# f5xc_network_policy (Resource)

Manages new network policy with configured parameters in specified namespace in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Network Policy Resource Example
# Manages new network policy with configured parameters in specified namespace in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Network Policy configuration
resource "f5xc_network_policy" "example" {
  name      = "example-network-policy"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Network Policy configuration
  endpoint {
    any {}
  }

  ingress_rules {
    metadata {
      name = "allow-http"
    }
    spec {
      action = "ALLOW"
      any    = {}
    }
  }

  egress_rules {
    metadata {
      name = "allow-all-egress"
    }
    spec {
      action = "ALLOW"
      any    = {}
    }

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the NetworkPolicy will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`endpoint` - (Optional) Endpoint Choice. Shape of the endpoint choices for a view. See [Endpoint](#endpoint) below for details.

`rules` - (Optional) Rule Choice. Shape of Rule Choice. See [Rules](#rules) below for details.

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="endpoint"></a>

### Endpoint

`any` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`inside_endpoints` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`label_selector` - (Optional) Label Selector. This type can be used to establish a 'selector reference' from one object(called selector) to a set of other objects(called selectees) based on the value of expresssions. A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. Label selector is immutable. expressions is a list of strings of label selection expression. Each string has ',' separated values which are 'AND' and all strings ar. See [Label Selector](#endpoint-label-selector) below.

`outside_endpoints` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`prefix_list` - (Optional) IPv4 Prefix List. x-example: '192.168.20.0/24' List of IPv4 prefixes that represent an endpoint. See [Prefix List](#endpoint-prefix-list) below.

<a id="endpoint-label-selector"></a>

### Endpoint Label Selector

`expressions` - (Optional) Selector Expression. expressions contains the kubernetes style label expression for selections (`List`).
