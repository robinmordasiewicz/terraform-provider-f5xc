# f5xc_network_policy_rule (Resource)

Manages network policy rule with configured parameters in specified namespace in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Network Policy Rule Resource Example
# Manages network policy rule with configured parameters in specified namespace in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Network Policy Rule configuration
resource "f5xc_network_policy_rule" "example" {
  name      = "example-network-policy-rule"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # Network Policy Rule Advanced Action. Network Policy Rule ...
  advanced_action {
    # Configure advanced_action settings
  }
  # [OneOf: ip_prefix_set, prefix, prefix_selector] IP Prefix...
  ip_prefix_set {
    # Configure ip_prefix_set settings
  }
  # Reference. A list of references to ip_prefix_set objects.

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the NetworkPolicyRule. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the NetworkPolicyRule will be created.

### Optional

- `action` (String) Network Policy Rule Action. Network policy rule action configures the action to be taken on rule match Apply deny action on rule match Apply allow action on rule match. Possible values are `DENY`, `ALLOW`.
- `advanced_action` (Block, Optional) Network Policy Rule Advanced Action. Network Policy Rule Advanced Action provides additional options along with RuleAction and PBRRuleAction (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--advanced_action))
- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `ip_prefix_set` (Block, Optional) [OneOf: ip_prefix_set, prefix, prefix_selector] IP Prefix Set Reference. A list of references to ip_prefix_set objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ip_prefix_set))
- `label_matcher` (Block, Optional) Label Matcher. A label matcher specifies a list of label keys whose values need to match for source/client and destination/server. Note that the actual label values are not specified and do not matter. This allows an ability to scope grouping by the label key name. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--label_matcher))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `ports` (List of String) List of Port Ranges. List of port ranges. Each range is a single port or a pair of start and end ports e.g. 8080-8192
- `prefix` (Block, Optional) IP Prefix List. List of IP Address prefixes. Prefix must contain both prefix and prefix-length The list can contain mix of both IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--prefix))
- `prefix_selector` (Block, Optional) Label Selector. This type can be used to establish a 'selector reference' from one object(called selector) to a set of other objects(called selectees) based on the value of expresssions. A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. Label selector is immutable. expressions is a list of strings of label selection expression. Each string has ',' separated values which are 'AND' and all strings ar... (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--prefix_selector))
- `protocol` (String) Protocol. Protocol in IP packet to be used as match criteria Values are tcp, udp, and icmp
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--advanced_action"></a>
### Nested Schema for `advanced_action`

Optional:

- `action` (String) Log Action. Choice to choose logging or no logging This works together with option selected via NetworkPolicyRuleAction or any other action specified x-example: (No Selection in NetworkPolicyRuleAction + AdvancedAction as LOG) = LOG Only, (ALLOW/DENY in NetworkPolicyRuleAction + AdvancedAction as LOG) = Log and Allow/Deny, (ALLOW/DENY in NetworkPolicyRuleAction + NOLOG in AdvancedAction) = Allow/Deny with no log Don't sample the traffic hitting the rule Sample the traffic hitting the rule. Possible values are `NOLOG`, `LOG`.


<a id="nestedblock--ip_prefix_set"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ip_prefix_set`

Optional:

- `ref` (Block List) Reference. A list of references to ip_prefix_set objects. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--ip_prefix_set--ref))

<a id="nestedblock--ip_prefix_set--ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `ip_prefix_set.ref`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then kind will hold the referred object's kind (e.g. 'route')
- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.
- `uid` (String) UID. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then uid will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) uid.



<a id="nestedblock--label_matcher"></a>
### Nested Schema for `label_matcher`

Optional:

- `keys` (List of String) Keys. The list of label key names that have to match


<a id="nestedblock--prefix"></a>
### Nested Schema for `prefix`

Optional:

- `prefix` (List of String) Prefix. IP Address prefix in string format. String must contain both prefix and prefix-length


<a id="nestedblock--prefix_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `prefix_selector`

Optional:

- `expressions` (List of String) Selector Expression. expressions contains the kubernetes style label expression for selections.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
