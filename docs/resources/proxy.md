<a id="dynamic-proxy-http-proxy-more-option"></a>

**Dynamic Proxy HTTP Proxy More Option**

`buffer_policy` - (Optional) Buffer Configuration. Some upstream applications are not capable of handling streamed data. This config enables buffering the entire request before sending to upstream application. We can specify the maximum buffer size and buffer interval with this config. Buffering can be enabled and disabled at VirtualHost and Route levels Route level buffer configuration takes precedence. See [Buffer Policy](#dynamic-proxy-http-proxy-more-option-buffer-policy) below.

`compression_params` - (Optional) Compression Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to compress dispatched data from an upstream service upon client request. The content is compressed and then sent to the client with the appropriate headers if either response and request allow. Only GZIP compression is supported. By default compression will be skipped when: A request does NOT contain accept-encoding header. A request includes accept-encoding header, but it does not contain “gzip” or “*”. A request includes accept-encoding with “gzip” or “*” with the weight “q=0”. Note that the “gzip” will have a higher weight then “*”. For example, if accept-encoding is “gzip;q=0,*;q=1”, the filter will not compress. But if the header is set to “*;q=0,gzip;q=1”, the filter will compress. A request whose accept-encoding header includes “identity”. A response contains a content-encoding header. A response contains a cache-control header whose value includes “no-transform”. A response contains a transfer-encoding header whose value includes “gzip”. A response does not contain a content-type value that matches one of the selected mime-types, which default to application/javascript, application/JSON, application/xhtml+XML, image/svg+XML, text/CSS, text/HTML, text/plain, text/XML. Neither content-length nor transfer-encoding headers are present in the response. Response size is smaller than 30 bytes (only applicable when transfer-encoding is not chunked). When compression is applied: The content-length is removed from response headers. Response headers contain “transfer-encoding: chunked” and do not contain “content-encoding” header. The “vary: accept-encoding” header is inserted on every response. GZIP Compression Level: A value which is optimal balance between speed of compression and amount of compression is chosen. See [Compression Params](#dynamic-proxy-http-proxy-more-option-compression-params) below.

`custom_errors` - (Optional) Custom Error Responses. Map of integer error codes as keys and string values that can be used to provide custom HTTP pages for each error code. Key of the map can be either response code class or HTTP Error code. Response code classes for key is configured as follows 3 -- for 3xx response code class 4 -- for 4xx response code class 5 -- for 5xx response code class Value of the map is string which represents custom HTTP responses. Specific response code takes preference when both response code and response code class matches for a request (`Block`).

`disable_default_error_pages` - (Optional) Disable Default Error Pages. Disable the use of default F5XC error pages (`Bool`).

`disable_path_normalize` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`enable_path_normalize` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

The stream is terminated with a HTTP 504 (Gateway Timeout) error code if no upstream response header has been received, otherwise the stream is reset (`Number`).

`max_request_header_size` - (Optional) Maximum Request Header Size. The maximum request header size for downstream connections, in KiB. A HTTP 431 (Request Header Fields Too Large) error code is sent for requests that exceed this size. If multiple load balancers share the same advertise_policy, the highest value configured across all such load balancers is used for all the load balancers in question (`Number`).

`request_cookies_to_add` - (Optional) Add Cookies in Cookie Header. Cookies are key-value pairs to be added to HTTP request being routed towards upstream. Cookies specified at this level are applied after cookies from matched Route are applied. See [Request Cookies To Add](#dynamic-proxy-http-proxy-more-option-request-cookies-to-add) below.

`buffer_policy` - (Optional) Buffer Configuration. Some upstream applications are not capable of handling streamed data. This config enables buffering the entire request before sending to upstream application. We can specify the maximum buffer size and buffer interval with this config. Buffering can be enabled and disabled at VirtualHost and Route levels Route level buffer configuration takes precedence. See [Buffer Policy](#http-proxy-more-option-buffer-policy) below.

`compression_params` - (Optional) Compression Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to compress dispatched data from an upstream service upon client request. The content is compressed and then sent to the client with the appropriate headers if either response and request allow. Only GZIP compression is supported. By default compression will be skipped when: A request does NOT contain accept-encoding header. A request includes accept-encoding header, but it does not contain “gzip” or “*”. A request includes accept-encoding with “gzip” or “*” with the weight “q=0”. Note that the “gzip” will have a higher weight then “*”. For example, if accept-encoding is “gzip;q=0,*;q=1”, the filter will not compress. But if the header is set to “*;q=0,gzip;q=1”, the filter will compress. A request whose accept-encoding header includes “identity”. A response contains a content-encoding header. A response contains a cache-control header whose value includes “no-transform”. A response contains a transfer-encoding header whose value includes “gzip”. A response does not contain a content-type value that matches one of the selected mime-types, which default to application/javascript, application/JSON, application/xhtml+XML, image/svg+XML, text/CSS, text/HTML, text/plain, text/XML. Neither content-length nor transfer-encoding headers are present in the response. Response size is smaller than 30 bytes (only applicable when transfer-encoding is not chunked). When compression is applied: The content-length is removed from response headers. Response headers contain “transfer-encoding: chunked” and do not contain “content-encoding” header. The “vary: accept-encoding” header is inserted on every response. GZIP Compression Level: A value which is optimal balance between speed of compression and amount of compression is chosen. See [Compression Params](#http-proxy-more-option-compression-params) below.

`custom_errors` - (Optional) Custom Error Responses. Map of integer error codes as keys and string values that can be used to provide custom HTTP pages for each error code. Key of the map can be either response code class or HTTP Error code. Response code classes for key is configured as follows 3 -- for 3xx response code class 4 -- for 4xx response code class 5 -- for 5xx response code class Value of the map is string which represents custom HTTP responses. Specific response code takes preference when both response code and response code class matches for a request (`Block`).

A HTTP 431 (Request Header Fields Too Large) error code is sent for requests that exceed this size.
