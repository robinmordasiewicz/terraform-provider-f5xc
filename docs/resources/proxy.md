A request includes accept-encoding. See [Compression Params](#dynamic-proxy-http-proxy-more-option-compression-params) below.

`custom_errors` - (Optional) Custom Error Responses. Map of integer error codes as keys and string values that can be used to provide custom HTTP pages for each error code. Key of the map can be either response code class or HTTP Error code. Response code classes for key is configured as follows 3 -- for 3xx response code class 4 -- for 4xx response code class 5 -- for 5xx response code class Value of the map is string which represents custom HTTP responses.
