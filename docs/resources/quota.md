## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the Quota. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the Quota will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `api_limits` (Block, Optional) API Limits. API Limits defines ratelimit parameters for an API at the stdlib service The key of the api_limits map is rpc FQN e.g. 'ves.io.schema.advertise_policy.API.Create' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--api_limits))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `object_limits` (Block, Optional) Object Limits. Object Limits define maximum number of instances that can be present per object kind for the tenant The key of the object_limits map is object kind e.g. 'virtual_host' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--object_limits))
- `resource_limits` (Block, Optional) Resource Limits. Resource Limits define maximum value of resources in the appropriate units that can be present. The key of the resource limits is the resource name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--resource_limits))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

### Nested Schema for `api_limits`


<a id="nestedblock--object_limits"></a>
### Nested Schema for `object_limits`


<a id="nestedblock--resource_limits"></a>
### Nested Schema for `resource_limits`


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
