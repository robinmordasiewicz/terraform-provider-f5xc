# f5xc_rate_limiter (Resource)

Manages rate_limiter creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Rate Limiter Resource Example
# Manages rate_limiter creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Rate Limiter configuration
resource "f5xc_rate_limiter" "example" {
  name      = "example-rate-limiter"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Rate Limiter configuration
  total_number     = 100
  unit             = "MINUTE"
  burst_multiplier = 10
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the RateLimiter. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the RateLimiter will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `limits` (Block List) Rate Limit Values. A list of RateLimitValues that specifies the total number of allowed requests for each specified period. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `user_identification` (Block List) User Identification Policy. A reference to user_identification object. The rules in the user_identification object are evaluated to determine the user identifier to be rate limited. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--user_identification))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--limits"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limits`

Optional:

- `action_block` (Block, Optional) Rate Limit Block Action. Action where a user is blocked from making further requests after exceeding rate limit threshold. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits--action_block))
- `burst_multiplier` (Number) Burst Multiplier. The maximum burst of requests to accommodate, expressed as a multiple of the rate.
- `disabled` (Block, Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits--disabled))
- `leaky_bucket` (Block, Optional) Leaky Bucket Rate Limiter. Leaky-Bucket is the default rate limiter algorithm for F5 (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits--leaky_bucket))
- `period_multiplier` (Number) Periods. This setting, combined with Per Period units, provides a duration
- `token_bucket` (Block, Optional) Token Bucket Rate Limiter. Token-Bucket is a rate limiter algorithm that is stricter with enforcing limits (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits--token_bucket))
- `total_number` (Number) Number Of Requests. The total number of allowed requests per rate-limiting period.
- `unit` (String) Rate Limit Period Unit. Unit for the period per which the rate limit is applied. - SECOND: Second Rate limit period unit is seconds - MINUTE: Minute Rate limit period unit is minutes - HOUR: Hour Rate limit period unit is hours - DAY: Day Rate limit period unit is days. Possible values are `SECOND`, `MINUTE`, `HOUR`.

### Nested Schema for `limits.action_block`

Optional:

- `hours` (Block, Optional) Hours. Input Duration Hours (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits--action_block--hours))
- `minutes` (Block, Optional) Minutes. Input Duration Minutes (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits--action_block--minutes))
- `seconds` (Block, Optional) Seconds. Input Duration Seconds (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--limits--action_block--seconds))

<a id="nestedblock--limits--action_block--hours"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limits.action_block.hours`

Optional:

- `duration` (Number) Duration.


<a id="nestedblock--limits--action_block--minutes"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limits.action_block.minutes`

Optional:

- `duration` (Number) Duration.


<a id="nestedblock--limits--action_block--seconds"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limits.action_block.seconds`

Optional:

- `duration` (Number) Duration.



<a id="nestedblock--limits--disabled"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limits.disabled`


<a id="nestedblock--limits--leaky_bucket"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limits.leaky_bucket`


<a id="nestedblock--limits--token_bucket"></a>
### Nested Schema for `limits.token_bucket`



<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).


<a id="nestedblock--user_identification"></a>
### Nested Schema for `user_identification`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then kind will hold the referred object's kind (e.g. 'route')
- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.
- `uid` (String) UID. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then uid will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) uid.
