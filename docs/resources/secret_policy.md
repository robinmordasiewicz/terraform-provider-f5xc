# f5xc_secret_policy (Resource)

Manages secret_policy creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Secret Policy Resource Example
# Manages secret_policy creates a new object in the storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Secret Policy configuration
resource "f5xc_secret_policy" "example" {
  name      = "example-secret-policy"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Secret Policy configuration
  algo = "DENY_OVERRIDES"

  rules {
    metadata {
      name = "allow-team-secrets"
    }
    spec {
      action = "ALLOW"
      secret_match {
        regex {
          regex = "team-.*"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the SecretPolicy. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the SecretPolicy will be created.

### Optional

- `allow_f5xc` (Boolean) Allow F5XC. if allow_f5xc is set to true, it allows relevant F5XC infrastructure services to decrypt the secret encrypted using this policy.
- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `decrypt_cache_timeout` (String) Decrypt Cache Timeout. decrypt_cache_timeout contains the amount of time a decrypted secret is cached in wingman. Value for this parameter is a string ending in the suffix 's' (indicating seconds), suffix 'm' (indicating minutes) or suffix 'h' (indicating hours)
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `rule_list` (Block, Optional) Rule List. A list of rules. The order of evaluation of the rules depends on the rule combining algorithm. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule_list))
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--rule_list"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule_list`

Optional:

- `rules` (Block List) Rules. Define the list of rules (with an order) that should be evaluated by this service policy. Rules are evaluated from top to bottom in the list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule_list--rules))

<a id="nestedblock--rule_list--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule_list.rules`

Optional:

- `metadata` (Block, Optional) Message Metadata. MessageMetaType is metadata (common attributes) of a message that only certain messages have. This information is propagated to the metadata of a child object that gets created from the containing message during view processing. The information in this type can be specified by user during create and replace APIs. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule_list--rules--metadata))
- `spec` (Block, Optional) Global Specifications. A secret_policy_rule object consists of an unordered list of predicates and an action. The predicates are evaluated against a set of input fields that are extracted from client certificate. A rule is considered to match if all predicates in the rule evaluate to true for that request. Any predicates that are not specified in a rule are implicitly considered to be true. If a rule is matched, the action specified for the rule is enforced for that request. A secret_policy_r...

<a id="nestedblock--rule_list--rules--metadata"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule_list.rules.metadata`

Optional:

- `description` (String) Description. Human readable description.
- `name` (String) Name. This is the name of the message. The value of name has to follow DNS-1035 format.


<a id="nestedblock--rule_list--rules--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `rule_list.rules.spec`

Optional:

- `action` (String) Rule Action. The rule action determines the disposition of the input request API. If a policy matches a rule with an ALLOW action, the processing of the request proceeds forward. If it matches a rule with a DENY action, the processing of the request is terminated and an appropriate message/code returned to the originator. If it matches a rule with a NEXT_POLICY_SET action, evaluation of the current policy set terminates and evaluation of the next policy set in the chain begins. - DENY: DENY D... Possible values are `DENY`, `ALLOW`, `NEXT_POLICY`.
- `client_name` (String) Client Name. The name of the client trying to access the secret. Name of the client will be extracted from client TLS certificate. This predicate evaluates to true if client name matches the configured name
- `client_name_matcher` (Block, Optional) Matcher. A matcher specifies multiple criteria for matching an input string. The match is considered successful if any of the criteria are satisfied. The set of supported match criteria includes a list of exact values and a list of regular expressions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--rule_list--rules--spec--client_name_matcher))
- `client_selector` (Block, Optional) Label Selector. This type can be used to establish a 'selector reference' from one object(called selector) to a set of other objects(called selectees) based on the value of expresssions. A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. Label selector is immutable. expressions is a list of strings of label selection expression. Each string has ',' separated values which are 'AND' and all strings ar...

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
