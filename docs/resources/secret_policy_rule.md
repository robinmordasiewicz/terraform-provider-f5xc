# f5xc_secret_policy_rule (Resource)

Manages secret_policy_rule creates a new object in storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Secret Policy Rule Resource Example
# Manages secret_policy_rule creates a new object in storage backend for metadata.namespace. in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Secret Policy Rule configuration
resource "f5xc_secret_policy_rule" "example" {
  name      = "example-secret-policy-rule"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the SecretPolicyRule. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the SecretPolicyRule will be created.

### Optional

- `action` (String) Rule Action. The rule action determines the disposition of the input request API. If a policy matches a rule with an ALLOW action, the processing of the request proceeds forward. If it matches a rule with a DENY action, the processing of the request is terminated and an appropriate message/code returned to the originator. If it matches a rule with a NEXT_POLICY_SET action, evaluation of the current policy set terminates and evaluation of the next policy set in the chain begins. - DENY: DENY D... Possible values are `DENY`, `ALLOW`, `NEXT_POLICY`.
- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `client_name` (String) [OneOf: client_name, client_name_matcher, client_selector] Client Name. The name of the client trying to access the secret. Name of the client will be extracted from client TLS certificate. This predicate evaluates to true if client name matches the configured name
- `client_name_matcher` (Block, Optional) Matcher. A matcher specifies multiple criteria for matching an input string. The match is considered successful if any of the criteria are satisfied. The set of supported match criteria includes a list of exact values and a list of regular expressions. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--client_name_matcher))
- `client_selector` (Block, Optional) Label Selector. This type can be used to establish a 'selector reference' from one object(called selector) to a set of other objects(called selectees) based on the value of expresssions. A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. Label selector is immutable. expressions is a list of strings of label selection expression. Each string has ',' separated values which are 'AND' and all strings ar... (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--client_selector))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--client_name_matcher"></a>
### Nested Schema for `client_name_matcher`

Optional:

- `exact_values` (List of String) Exact Values. A list of exact values to match the input against.
- `regex_values` (List of String) Regex Values. A list of regular expressions to match the input against.


<a id="nestedblock--client_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `client_selector`

Optional:

- `expressions` (List of String) Selector Expression. expressions contains the kubernetes style label expression for selections.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
