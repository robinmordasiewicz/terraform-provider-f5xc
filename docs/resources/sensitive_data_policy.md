# Basic Sensitive Data Policy configuration
resource "f5xc_sensitive_data_policy" "example" {
  name      = "example-sensitive-data-policy"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the SensitiveDataPolicy. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the SensitiveDataPolicy will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `compliances` (List of String) Compliance Frameworks. Select relevant compliance frameworks, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS, to ensure monitoring under your sensitive data discovery.
- `custom_data_types` (Block List) Defined Custom Sensitive Data Types. Select your custom data types to be monitored in the API discovery (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--custom_data_types))
- `disabled_predefined_data_types` (List of String) Disabled Built-In Sensitive Data Types. Select which pre-configured data types to disable, disabled data types will not be shown as sensitive in the API discovery
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--custom_data_types"></a>
### Nested Schema for `custom_data_types`

Optional:

- `custom_data_type_ref` (Block, Optional) Object reference. This type establishes a direct reference from one object(the referrer) to another(the referred). Such a reference is in form of tenant/namespace/name (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--custom_data_types--custom_data_type_ref))

<a id="nestedblock--custom_data_types--custom_data_type_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `custom_data_types.custom_data_type_ref`

Optional:

- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.



<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
