- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the ServicePolicyRule will be created.

### Optional

- `action` (String) Rule Action. The rule action determines the disposition of the input request API. If a policy matches a rule with an ALLOW action, the processing of the request proceeds forward. If it matches a rule with a DENY action, the processing of the request is terminated and an appropriate message/code returned to the originator. If it matches a rule with a NEXT_POLICY_SET action, evaluation of the current policy set terminates and evaluation of the next policy set in the chain begins. - DENY: DENY D... Possible values are `DENY`, `ALLOW`, `NEXT_POLICY`.
