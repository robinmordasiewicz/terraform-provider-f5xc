## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the Srv6NetworkSlice. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the Srv6NetworkSlice will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `connect_to_access_networks` (Boolean) Connect To Access Networks. Connect all SRv6 Virtual Networks in this slice to their corresponding access networks by importing route targets specified in the virtual network.
- `connect_to_enterprise_networks` (Boolean) Connect To Enterprise Networks. Connect all SRv6 Virtual Networks in this slice to their corresponding enterprise networks by importing route targets specified in the virtual network.
- `connect_to_internet` (Boolean) Connect To Internet. Connect all SRv6 Virtual Networks in this slice to the Internet by importing route targets specified in the virtual network.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `sid_prefixes` (List of String) IPv6 Prefix for SID Allocation. A SID Locator from the prefix is allocated automatically for each node in each site.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
