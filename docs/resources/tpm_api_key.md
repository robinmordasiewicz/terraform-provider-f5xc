# f5xc_tpm_api_key (Resource)

Manages a TpmAPIKey resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for apikey object when successfully created returns actual apikey bytes which is used by the users to call in to tpm provisioning api. configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Tpm Api Key Resource Example
# Manages a TpmAPIKey resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for apikey object when successfully created returns actual apikey bytes which is used by the users to call in to tpm provisioning api. configuration.

# Basic Tpm Api Key configuration
resource "f5xc_tpm_api_key" "example" {
  name      = "example-tpm-api-key"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # TPM Category. APIKey needs a reference to an existing TPM...
  category_ref {
    # Configure category_ref settings
  }

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the TpmAPIKey. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the TpmAPIKey will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `category_ref` (Block List) TPM Category. APIKey needs a reference to an existing TPM category object TPM category is used for grouping customer owned APIKeys and manage them as one entity (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--category_ref))
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `need_mtls` (Boolean) Need mTLS. is mTLS required when using this APIKey?
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--category_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `category_ref`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then kind will hold the referred object's kind (e.g. 'route')
- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.
- `uid` (String) UID. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then uid will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) uid.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
