# f5xc_tpm_api_key (Resource)

Manages a TpmAPIKey resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for apikey object when successfully created returns actual apikey bytes which is used by the users to call in to tpm provisioning api. configuration.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Tpm Api Key Resource Example
# Manages a TpmAPIKey resource in F5 Distributed Cloud for apikey object when successfully created returns actual apikey bytes which is used by the users to call in to tpm provisioning api. configuration.

# Basic Tpm Api Key configuration
resource "f5xc_tpm_api_key" "example" {
  name      = "example-tpm-api-key"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # TPM Category. APIKey needs a reference to an existing TPM...

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

`name` - (Required) Name of the TpmAPIKey. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the TpmAPIKey will be created (`String`).

The following arguments are optional:

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`category_ref` - (Optional) TPM Category. APIKey needs a reference to an existing TPM category object TPM category is used for grouping customer owned APIKeys and manage them as one entity. See [Category Ref](#category-ref) below for details.

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`need_mtls` - (Optional) Need mTLS. is mTLS required when using this APIKey? (`Bool`).

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

<a id="nestedblock--category_ref"></a>

### Category Ref

`kind` - (Optional) Kind. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then kind will hold the referred object's kind (e.g. 'route') (`String`).

`name` - (Optional) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name (`String`).

`namespace` - (Optional) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace (`String`).

<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>

### Timeouts

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
