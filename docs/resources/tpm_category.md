# f5xc_tpm_category (Resource)

Manages Category object, which is a grouping of APIKeys used for TPM provisioning in F5 Distributed Cloud.

~> **Note** For more information about this resource, please refer to the [F5 XC API Documentation](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/api/).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Tpm Category Resource Example
# Manages Category object, which is a grouping of APIKeys used for TPM provisioning in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Tpm Category configuration
resource "f5xc_tpm_category" "example" {
  name      = "example-tpm-category"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Resource-specific configuration
  # TPM Manager reference. Reference to TPM Manager
  tpm_manager_ref {
    # Configure tpm_manager_ref settings
  }
}

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the TpmCategory. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the TpmCategory will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))
- `tpm_allow_list` (List of String) list of allowed TPM EK Certificates. A TPM manufacturer is typically identified by its EK certificate. TPMAdmin can configure a allow-list of EK certificates for a given category When a TPM provision request is called, TPMAuthority verifies that EK certificate provided in provision matches one the EK certificate on this allow-list Allow list of TPM EK Certificates
- `tpm_manager_ref` (Block List) TPM Manager reference. Reference to TPM Manager (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--tpm_manager_ref))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

### Nested Schema for `tpm_manager_ref`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then kind will hold the referred object's kind (e.g. 'route')
- `name` (String) Name. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then name will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) name.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then namespace will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) namespace.
- `tenant` (String) Tenant. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then tenant will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) tenant.
- `uid` (String) UID. When a configuration object(e.g. virtual_host) refers to another(e.g route) then uid will hold the referred object's(e.g. route's) uid.

## Import
