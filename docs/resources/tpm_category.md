# Basic Tpm Category configuration
resource "f5xc_tpm_category" "example" {
  name      = "example-tpm-category"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the TpmCategory. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the TpmCategory will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`timeouts` - (Optional) See [Timeouts](#timeouts) below for details.

`tpm_allow_list` - (Optional) list of allowed TPM EK Certificates. A TPM manufacturer is typically identified by its EK certificate. TPMAdmin can configure a allow-list of EK certificates for a given category When a TPM provision request is called, TPMAuthority verifies that EK certificate provided in provision matches one the EK certificate on this allow-list Allow list of TPM EK Certificates (`List`).

`tpm_manager_ref` - (Optional) TPM Manager reference. Reference to TPM Manager. See [Tpm Manager Ref](#tpm-manager-ref) below for details.

### Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

`id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the resource (`String`).

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m".
