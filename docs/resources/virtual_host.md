### Spec Argument Reference

&#x2022; [`add_location`](#add-location) - Optional Bool<br>Add Location. x-example: true Appends header x-volterra-location = <RE-site-name> in responses. This configuration is ignored on CE sites

&#x2022; [`advertise_policies`](#advertise-policies) - Optional Block<br>Advertise Policies. Advertise Policy allows you to define networks or sites where you want a VIP for this virtual host to be advertised. Each Policy rule can have different parameters, like TLS configuration, ports, optionally IP address to be used for VIP. If advertise policy is not specified then no VIP is assigned for this virtual host<br>See [Advertise Policies](#advertise-policies) below for details.

-> **One of the following:**
&#x2022; [`append_server_name`](#append-server-name) - Optional String<br>Append Server Name if absent. Specifies the value to be used for Server header if it is not already present. If Server Header is already present it is not overwritten. It is just passed
<br><br>&#x2022; [`default_header`](#default-header) - Optional Block<br>Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed
<br><br>&#x2022; [`pass_through`](#pass-through) - Optional Block<br>Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed
<br><br>&#x2022; [`server_name`](#server-name) - Optional String<br>Server Name. Specifies the value to be used for Server header inserted in responses. This will overwrite existing values if any for Server Header

-> **One of the following:**
&#x2022; [`authentication`](#authentication) - Optional Block<br>Authentication Details. Authentication related information. This allows to configure the URL to redirect after the authentication Authentication Object Reference, configuration of cookie params etc<br>See [Authentication](#authentication) below for details.
<br><br>&#x2022; [`no_authentication`](#no-authentication) - Optional Block<br>Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed

&#x2022; [`buffer_policy`](#buffer-policy) - Optional Block<br>Buffer Configuration. Some upstream applications are not capable of handling streamed data. This config enables buffering the entire request before sending to upstream application. We can specify the maximum buffer size and buffer interval with this config. Buffering can be enabled and disabled at VirtualHost and Route levels Route level buffer configuration takes precedence<br>See [Buffer Policy](#buffer-policy) below for details.

-> **One of the following:**
&#x2022; [`captcha_challenge`](#captcha-challenge) - Optional Block<br>Captcha Challenge Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to perform captcha challenge Captcha challenge will be based on Google Recaptcha. With this feature enabled, only clients that pass the captcha challenge will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Captcha Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have captcha challenge embedded in it. Client will be allowed to make the request only if the captcha challenge is successful. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Captcha challenge for subsequent requests. CAPTCHA is mainly used as a security check to ensure only human users can pass through. Generally, computers or bots are not capable of solving a captcha. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host<br>See [Captcha Challenge](#captcha-challenge) below for details.
<br><br>&#x2022; [`js_challenge`](#js-challenge) - Optional Block<br>Javascript Challenge Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to perform client browser compatibility test by redirecting to a page with Javascript. With this feature enabled, only clients that are capable of executing Javascript(mostly browsers) will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Javascript Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have Javascript embedded in it. Loadbalancer chooses a set of random numbers for every new client and sends these numbers along with an encrypted answer with the request such that it embed these numbers as input in the Javascript. Javascript will run on the requestor browser and perform a complex Math operation. Script will submit the answer to loadbalancer. Loadbalancer will validate the answer by comparing the calculated answer with the decrypted answer (which was encrypted when it was sent back as reply) and allow the request to the upstream server only if the answer is correct. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Javascript challenge for subsequent requests. Javascript challenge serves following purposes * Validate that the request is coming via a browser that is capable for running Javascript * Force the browser to run a complex operation, f(X), that requires it to spend a large number of CPU cycles. This is to slow down a potential DOS attacker by making it difficult to launch a large request flood without having to spend even larger CPU cost at their end. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host<br>See [Js Challenge](#js-challenge) below for details.
<br><br>&#x2022; [`no_challenge`](#no-challenge) - Optional Block<br>Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed

&#x2022; [`compression_params`](#compression-params) - Optional Block<br>Compression Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to compress dispatched data from an upstream service upon client request. The content is compressed and then sent to the client with the appropriate headers if either response and request allow. Only GZIP compression is supported. By default compression will be skipped when: A request does NOT contain accept-encoding header. A request includes accept-encoding header, but it does not contain “gzip” or “*”. A request includes accept-encoding with “gzip” or “*” with the weight “q=0”. Note that the “gzip” will have a higher weight then “*”. For example, if accept-encoding is “gzip;q=0,*;q=1”, the filter will not compress. But if the header is set to “*;q=0,gzip;q=1”, the filter will compress. A request whose accept-encoding header includes “identity”. A response contains a content-encoding header. A response contains a cache-control header whose value includes “no-transform”. A response contains a transfer-encoding header whose value includes “gzip”. A response does not contain a content-type value that matches one of the selected mime-types, which default to application/javascript, application/JSON, application/xhtml+XML, image/svg+XML, text/CSS, text/HTML, text/plain, text/XML. Neither content-length nor transfer-encoding headers are present in the response. Response size is smaller than 30 bytes (only applicable when transfer-encoding is not chunked). When compression is applied: The content-length is removed from response headers. Response headers contain “transfer-encoding: chunked” and do not contain “content-encoding” header. The “vary: accept-encoding” header is inserted on every response. GZIP Compression Level: A value which is optimal balance between speed of compression and amount of compression is chosen<br>See [Compression Params](#compression-params) below for details.

&#x2022; [`connection_idle_timeout`](#connection-idle-timeout) - Optional Number  Defaults to `2`  Specified in milliseconds<br>Connection Idle Timeout. The idle timeout for downstream connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. When the idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive.  The minutes

&#x2022; [`csrf_policy`](#csrf-policy) - Optional Block<br>CSRF Policy. To mitigate CSRF attack , the policy checks where a request is coming from to determine if the request's origin is the same as its detination.The policy relies on two pieces of information used in determining if a request originated from the same host. 1. The origin that caused the user agent to issue the request (source origin). 2. The origin that the request is going to (target origin). When the policy evaluating a request, it ensures both pieces of information are present and compare their values. If the source origin is missing or origins do not match the request is rejected. The exception to this being if the source-origin has been added to they policy as valid. Because CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, the policy only acts on the HTTP requests that have state-changing method (PUT,POST, etc.)<br>See [CSRF Policy](#csrf-policy) below for details.

&#x2022; [`custom_errors`](#custom-errors) - Optional Block<br>Custom Error Responses. Map of integer error codes as keys and string values that can be used to provide custom HTTP pages for each error code. Key of the map can be either response code class or HTTP Error code. Response code classes for key is configured as follows 3 -- for 3xx response code class 4 -- for 4xx response code class 5 -- for 5xx response code class Value is the uri_ref. Currently supported URL schemes is string:///. For string:/// scheme, message needs to be encoded in Base64 format. You can specify this message as base64 encoded plain text message e.g. 'Access Denied' or it can be HTML paragraph or a body string encoded as base64 string E.g. '<p> Access Denied </p>'. Base64 encoded string for this HTML is 'PHA+IEFjY2VzcyBEZW5pZWQgPC9wPg==' Specific response code takes preference when both response code and response code class matches for a request. The configured custom errors are only applicable for loadbalancer generated errors. Errors returned from upstream server is propagated as is. F5XC provides default error pages for the errors generated by the loadbalancer. Content of these pages are not editable. User has an option to disable the use of default F5XC error pages

-> **One of the following:**

Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form Supported Domains and search order: 1. Exact Domain names: `www.foo.com.` 2. Domains starting with a Wildcard: *.foo.com. Not supported Domains: - Just a Wildcard: * - A Wildcard and TLD with no root Domain: *.com. - A Wildcard not matching a whole DNS label. e.g. *.foo.com and *.bar.foo.com are valid Wildcards however *bar.foo.com, *-bar.foo.com, and bar*.foo.com are all invalid. Additional notes: A Wildcard will not match empty string. e.g. *.foo.com will match bar.foo.com and baz-bar.foo.com but not .foo.com. The longest Wildcards match first. Only a single virtual host in the entire route configuration can match on *. Also a Domain must be unique across all virtual hosts within an advertise policy. Domains are also used for SNI matching if the virtual host proxy type is TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI/HTTPS_PROXY Domains also indicate the list of names for which DNS resolution will be automatically resolved to IP addresses by the system

&#x2022; [`dynamic_reverse_proxy`](#dynamic-reverse-proxy) - Optional Block<br>Dynamic Reverse Proxy Type. In this mode of proxy, virtual host will resolve the destination endpoint dynamically. The dynamic resolution is done using a predefined field in the request. This predefined field depends on the ProxyType configured on the Virtual Host. For HTTP traffic, i.e. with ProxyType as HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY, virtual host will use the 'HOST' HTTP header from the request and perform DNS resolution to select destination endpoint. For TCP traffic with SNI, (If the ProxyType is TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI), virtual host will perform DNS resolution using the SNI. The DNS resolution is performed in the virtual network specified in outside_network_type or outside_network In both modes of operation(either using Host header or SNI), the DNS resolution could return multiple addresses. First IPv4 address from such returned list is used as endpoint for the request. The DNS response is cached for 60s by default<br>See [Dynamic Reverse Proxy](#dynamic-reverse-proxy) below for details.

Each time an encode/decode event for headers or data is processed for the stream, the timer will be reset. If the timeout fires, the stream is terminated with a 504 (Gateway Timeout) error code if no upstream response header has been received, otherwise a stream reset occurs. The default idle timeout is 30 seconds TCP PROXY, TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI, SMA_PROXY: The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no bytes sent or received on either the upstream or downstream connection. The default idle timeout is 1 hour. UDP PROXY: The idle timeout for sessions. Idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no datagrams sent or received on the session.
