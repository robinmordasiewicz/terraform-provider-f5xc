Each Policy rule can have different parameters, like TLS configuration, ports, optionally ip address to be used for VIP. If advertise policy is not specified then no VIP is assigned for this virtual host. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--advertise_policies))
- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
