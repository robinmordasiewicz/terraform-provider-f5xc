## Argument Reference

### Metadata Argument Reference

`name` - (Required) Name of the VirtualHost. Must be unique within the namespace (`String`).

`namespace` - (Required) Namespace where the VirtualHost will be created (`String`).

`annotations` - (Optional) Annotations to apply to this resource (`Map`).

`labels` - (Optional) Labels to apply to this resource (`Map`).

### Spec Argument Reference

`add_location` - (Optional) Add Location. x-example: true Appends header x-volterra-location = <RE-site-name> in responses. This configuration is ignored on CE sites (`Bool`).

`advertise_policies` - (Optional) Advertise Policies. Advertise Policy allows you to define networks or sites where you want a VIP for this virtual host to be advertised. Each Policy rule can have different parameters, like TLS configuration, ports, optionally IP address to be used for VIP. If advertise policy is not specified then no VIP is assigned for this virtual host. See [Advertise Policies](#advertise-policies) below for details.

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "append_server_name, default_header, pass_through, server_name" must be set.

`append_server_name` - (Optional) Append Server Name if absent. Specifies the value to be used for Server header if it is not already present. If Server Header is already present it is not overwritten. It is just passed (`String`).

`default_header` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`pass_through` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`server_name` - (Optional) Server Name. Specifies the value to be used for Server header inserted in responses. This will overwrite existing values if any for Server Header (`String`).

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "authentication, no_authentication" must be set.

`authentication` - (Optional) Authentication Details. Authentication related information. This allows to configure the URL to redirect after the authentication Authentication Object Reference, configuration of cookie params etc. See [Authentication](#authentication) below for details.

`no_authentication` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`buffer_policy` - (Optional) Buffer Configuration. Some upstream applications are not capable of handling streamed data. This config enables buffering the entire request before sending to upstream application. We can specify the maximum buffer size and buffer interval with this config. Buffering can be enabled and disabled at VirtualHost and Route levels Route level buffer configuration takes precedence. See [Buffer Policy](#buffer-policy) below for details.

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "captcha_challenge, js_challenge, no_challenge" must be set.

`captcha_challenge` - (Optional) Captcha Challenge Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to perform captcha challenge Captcha challenge will be based on Google Recaptcha. With this feature enabled, only clients that pass the captcha challenge will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Captcha Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have captcha challenge embedded in it. Client will be allowed to make the request only if the captcha challenge is successful. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Captcha challenge for subsequent requests. CAPTCHA is mainly used as a security check to ensure only human users can pass through. Generally, computers or bots are not capable of solving a captcha. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host. See [Captcha Challenge](#captcha-challenge) below for details.

`js_challenge` - (Optional) Javascript Challenge Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to perform client browser compatibility test by redirecting to a page with Javascript. With this feature enabled, only clients that are capable of executing Javascript(mostly browsers) will be allowed to complete the HTTP request. When loadbalancer is configured to do Javascript Challenge, it will redirect the browser to an HTML page on every new HTTP request. This HTML page will have Javascript embedded in it. Loadbalancer chooses a set of random numbers for every new client and sends these numbers along with an encrypted answer with the request such that it embed these numbers as input in the Javascript. Javascript will run on the requestor browser and perform a complex Math operation. Script will submit the answer to loadbalancer. Loadbalancer will validate the answer by comparing the calculated answer with the decrypted answer (which was encrypted when it was sent back as reply) and allow the request to the upstream server only if the answer is correct. Loadbalancer will tag response header with a cookie to avoid Javascript challenge for subsequent requests. Javascript challenge serves following purposes * Validate that the request is coming via a browser that is capable for running Javascript * Force the browser to run a complex operation, f(X), that requires it to spend a large number of CPU cycles. This is to slow down a potential DOS attacker by making it difficult to launch a large request flood without having to spend even larger CPU cost at their end. You can enable either Javascript challenge or Captcha challenge on a virtual host. See [Js Challenge](#js-challenge) below for details.

`no_challenge` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`coalescing_options` - (Optional) TLS Coalescing Options. TLS connection coalescing configuration (not compatible with mTLS). See [Coalescing Options](#coalescing-options) below for details.

`compression_params` - (Optional) Compression Parameters. Enables loadbalancer to compress dispatched data from an upstream service upon client request. The content is compressed and then sent to the client with the appropriate headers if either response and request allow. Only GZIP compression is supported. By default compression will be skipped when: A request does NOT contain accept-encoding header. A request includes accept-encoding header, but it does not contain “gzip” or “*”. A request includes accept-encoding with “gzip” or “*” with the weight “q=0”. Note that the “gzip” will have a higher weight then “*”. For example, if accept-encoding is “gzip;q=0,*;q=1”, the filter will not compress. But if the header is set to “*;q=0,gzip;q=1”, the filter will compress. A request whose accept-encoding header includes “identity”. A response contains a content-encoding header. A response contains a cache-control header whose value includes “no-transform”. A response contains a transfer-encoding header whose value includes “gzip”. A response does not contain a content-type value that matches one of the selected mime-types, which default to application/javascript, application/JSON, application/xhtml+XML, image/svg+XML, text/CSS, text/HTML, text/plain, text/XML. Neither content-length nor transfer-encoding headers are present in the response. Response size is smaller than 30 bytes (only applicable when transfer-encoding is not chunked). When compression is applied: The content-length is removed from response headers. Response headers contain “transfer-encoding: chunked” and do not contain “content-encoding” header. The “vary: accept-encoding” header is inserted on every response. GZIP Compression Level: A value which is optimal balance between speed of compression and amount of compression is chosen. See [Compression Params](#compression-params) below for details.

`connection_idle_timeout` - (Optional) Connection Idle Timeout. The idle timeout for downstream connections. The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active requests. When the idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive. This is specified in milliseconds. The default value is 2 minutes (`Number`).

`cors_policy` - (Optional) CORS Policy. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing requests configuration specified at Virtual-host or Route level. Route level configuration takes precedence. An example of an Cross origin HTTP request GET /resources/public-data/ HTTP/1.1 Host: bar.other User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081130 Minefield/3.1b3pre Accept: text/HTML,application/xhtml+XML,application/XML;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Connection: keep-alive Referrer: `HTTP://foo.example/examples/access-control/simpleXSInvocation.HTML` Origin: `HTTP://foo.example` HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2008 00:23:53 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.61 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * Keep-Alive: timeout=2, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Transfer-Encoding: chunked Content-Type: application/XML An example for cross origin HTTP OPTIONS request with Access-Control-Request-* header OPTIONS /resources/post-here/ HTTP/1.1 Host: bar.other User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.1b3pre) Gecko/20081130 Minefield/3.1b3pre Accept: text/HTML,application/xhtml+XML,application/XML;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Connection: keep-alive Origin: `HTTP://foo.example` Access-Control-Request-Method: POST Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type HTTP/1.1 204 No Content Date: Mon, 01 Dec 2008 01:15:39 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.61 (Unix) Access-Control-Allow-Origin: `HTTP://foo.example` Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, GET, OPTIONS Access-Control-Allow-Headers: X-PINGOTHER, Content-Type Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400 Vary: Accept-Encoding, Origin Keep-Alive: timeout=2, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive. See [CORS Policy](#cors-policy) below for details.

`csrf_policy` - (Optional) CSRF Policy. To mitigate CSRF attack , the policy checks where a request is coming from to determine if the request's origin is the same as its detination.The policy relies on two pieces of information used in determining if a request originated from the same host. 1. The origin that caused the user agent to issue the request (source origin). 2. The origin that the request is going to (target origin). When the policy evaluating a request, it ensures both pieces of information are present and compare their values. If the source origin is missing or origins do not match the request is rejected. The exception to this being if the source-origin has been added to they policy as valid. Because CSRF attacks specifically target state-changing requests, the policy only acts on the HTTP requests that have state-changing method (PUT,POST, etc.). See [CSRF Policy](#csrf-policy) below for details.

`custom_errors` - (Optional) Custom Error Responses. Map of integer error codes as keys and string values that can be used to provide custom HTTP pages for each error code. Key of the map can be either response code class or HTTP Error code. Response code classes for key is configured as follows 3 -- for 3xx response code class 4 -- for 4xx response code class 5 -- for 5xx response code class Value is the uri_ref. Currently supported URL schemes is string:///. For string:/// scheme, message needs to be encoded in Base64 format. You can specify this message as base64 encoded plain text message e.g. 'Access Denied' or it can be HTML paragraph or a body string encoded as base64 string E.g. '<p> Access Denied </p>'. Base64 encoded string for this HTML is 'PHA+IEFjY2VzcyBEZW5pZWQgPC9wPg==' Specific response code takes preference when both response code and response code class matches for a request. The configured custom errors are only applicable for loadbalancer generated errors. Errors returned from upstream server is propagated as is. F5XC provides default error pages for the errors generated by the loadbalancer. Content of these pages are not editable. User has an option to disable the use of default F5XC error pages (`Block`).

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "default_loadbalancer, non_default_loadbalancer" must be set.

`default_loadbalancer` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`non_default_loadbalancer` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`disable_default_error_pages` - (Optional) Disable default error pages. An option to specify whether to disable using default F5XC error pages (`Bool`).

`disable_dns_resolve` - (Optional) Disable DNS resolution. Disable DNS resolution for domains specified in the virtual host When the virtual host is configured as Dynamive Resolve Proxy (DRP), disable DNS resolution for domains configured. This configuration is suitable for HTTP CONNECT proxy (`Bool`).

> **Note:** One of the arguments from this list "disable_path_normalize, enable_path_normalize" must be set.

`disable_path_normalize` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`enable_path_normalize` - (Optional) Empty. This can be used for messages where no values are needed (`Block`).

`domains` - (Optional) Domains. A list of Domains (host/authority header) that will be matched to this Virtual Host. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form Supported Domains and search order: 1. Exact Domain names: `www.foo.com.` 2. Domains starting with a Wildcard: *.foo.com. Not supported Domains: - Just a Wildcard: * - A Wildcard and TLD with no root Domain: *.com. - A Wildcard not matching a whole DNS label. e.g. *.foo.com and *.bar.foo.com are valid Wildcards however *bar.foo.com, *-bar.foo.com, and bar*.foo.com are all invalid. Additional notes: A Wildcard will not match empty string. e.g. *.foo.com will match bar.foo.com and baz-bar.foo.com but not .foo.com. The longest Wildcards match first. Only a single virtual host in the entire route configuration can match on *. Also a Domain must be unique across all virtual hosts within an advertise policy. Domains are also used for SNI matching if the virtual host proxy type is TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI/HTTPS_PROXY Domains also indicate the list of names for which DNS resolution will be automatically resolved to IP addresses by the system (`List`).

`dynamic_reverse_proxy` - (Optional) Dynamic Reverse Proxy Type. In this mode of proxy, virtual host will resolve the destination endpoint dynamically. The dynamic resolution is done using a predefined field in the request. This predefined field depends on the ProxyType configured on the Virtual Host. For HTTP traffic, i.e. with ProxyType as HTTP_PROXY or HTTPS_PROXY, virtual host will use the 'HOST' HTTP header from the request and perform DNS resolution to select destination endpoint. For TCP traffic with SNI, (If the ProxyType is TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI), virtual host will perform DNS resolution using the SNI. The DNS resolution is performed in the virtual network specified in outside_network_type or outside_network In both modes of operation(either using Host header or SNI), the DNS resolution could return multiple addresses. First IPv4 address from such returned list is used as endpoint for the request. The DNS response is cached for 60s by default. See [Dynamic Reverse Proxy](#dynamic-reverse-proxy) below for details.

`http_protocol_options` - (Optional) HTTP Protocol Configuration Options. HTTP protocol configuration options for downstream connections. See [HTTP Protocol Options](#http-protocol-options) below for details.

`idle_timeout` - (Optional) Idle timeout (in milliseconds). Idle timeout is the amount of time that the loadbalancer will allow a stream to exist with no upstream or downstream activity. Idle timeout and Proxy Type: HTTP_PROXY, HTTPS_PROXY: Idle timer is started when the first byte is received on the connection. Each time an encode/decode event for headers or data is processed for the stream, the timer will be reset. If the timeout fires, the stream is terminated with a 504 (Gateway Timeout) error code if no upstream response header has been received, otherwise a stream reset occurs. The default idle timeout is 30 seconds TCP PROXY, TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI, SMA_PROXY: The idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no bytes sent or received on either the upstream or downstream connection. The default idle timeout is 1 hour. UDP PROXY: The idle timeout for sessions. Idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no datagrams sent or received on the session. The default if not specified is 1 minute (`Number`).

`max_request_header_size` - (Optional) Maximum Request Header Size (KiB). The maximum request header size in KiB for incoming connections. If un-configured, the default max request headers allowed is 60 KiB. Requests that exceed this limit will receive a 431 response. The max configurable limit is 96 KiB, based on current implementation constraints. Note: a. This configuration parameter is applicable only for HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY b. When multiple HTTP_PROXY virtual hosts share the same advertise policy, the effective 'maximum request header size' for such virtual hosts is the highest value configured on any of the virtual hosts (`Number`).

`proxy` - (Optional) Type of Proxy. ProxyType tells the type of proxy to install for the virtual host. Only the following combination of VirtualHosts within same AdvertisePolicy is permitted (None of them should have '*' in domains when used with other VirtualHosts in same AdvertisePolicy) 1. Multiple TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI and multiple HTTPS_PROXY 2. Multiple HTTP_PROXY 3. Multiple HTTPS_PROXY 4. Multiple TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI HTTPS_PROXY without TLS parameters is not permitted HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY/TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI/SMA_PROXY with empty domains is not permitted TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI/SMA_PROXY should not have '*' in domains - HTTP_PROXY: HTTP_PROXY Install HTTP proxy. HTTP Proxy is the default proxy installed. - TCP_PROXY: TCP_PROXY Install TCP proxy - TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI: TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI Install TCP proxy with SNI Routing - TLS_TCP_PROXY: TCP_PROXY Install TCP proxy - TLS_TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI: TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI Install TCP proxy with SNI Routing - HTTPS_PROXY: HTTPS_PROXY Install HTTPS proxy - UDP_PROXY: UDP_PROXY Install UDP proxy - SMA_PROXY: SMA_PROXY Install Secret Management Access proxy - DNS_PROXY: DNS_PROXY Install DNS proxy - ZTNA_PROXY: ZTNA_PROXY Install ZTNA proxy.This is going to be deprecated with UZTNA_PROXY. - UZTNA_PROXY: UZTNA_PROXY Install UZTNA proxy. Possible values are `UDP_PROXY`, `SMA_PROXY`, `DNS_PROXY`, `ZTNA_PROXY`, `UZTNA_PROXY`. Defaults to `HTTP_PROXY` (`String`).

`rate_limiter_allowed_prefixes` - (Optional) Rate Limiter Allowed Prefixes. References to ip_prefix_set objects.

For TCP traffic with SNI, (If the ProxyType is TCP_PROXY_WITH_SNI), virtual host will perform DNS resolution using the SNI. The DNS resolution is performed in the virtual network specified in outside_network_type or outside_network In both modes of operation(either using Host header or SNI), the DNS resolution could return multiple addresses. First IPv4 address from such returned list is used as endpoint for the request. The DNS response is cached for 60s by default (`Bool`).
