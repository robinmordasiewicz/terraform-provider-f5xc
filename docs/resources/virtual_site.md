```terraform
# Virtual Site Resource Example
# Manages virtual site object in given namespace in F5 Distributed Cloud.

# Basic Virtual Site configuration
resource "f5xc_virtual_site" "example" {
  name      = "example-virtual-site"
  namespace = "system"

  labels = {
    environment = "production"
    managed_by  = "terraform"
  }

  annotations = {
    "owner" = "platform-team"
  }

  # Virtual Site configuration
  site_type = "CUSTOMER_EDGE"

  # Site selector expression
  site_selector {
    expressions = ["region in (us-west-2, us-east-1)"]

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) Name of the VirtualSite. Must be unique within the namespace.
- `namespace` (String) Namespace where the VirtualSite will be created.

### Optional

- `annotations` (Map of String) Annotations to apply to this resource.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to apply to this resource.
- `site_selector` (Block, Optional) Label Selector. This type can be used to establish a 'selector reference' from one object(called selector) to a set of other objects(called selectees) based on the value of expresssions. A label selector is a label query over a set of resources. An empty label selector matches all objects. A null label selector matches no objects. Label selector is immutable. expressions is a list of strings of label selection expression. Each string has ',' separated values which are 'AND' and all strings ar... (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--site_selector))
- `site_type` (String) Site Type. Site Type which can either RE or CE Invalid type of site Regional Edge site Customer Edge site. Possible values are `INVALID`, `REGIONAL_EDGE`, `CUSTOMER_EDGE`, `NGINX_ONE`.
- `timeouts` (Block, Optional) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier for the resource.

<a id="nestedblock--site_selector"></a>
### Nested Schema for `site_selector`

Optional:

- `expressions` (List of String) Selector Expression. expressions contains the kubernetes style label expression for selections.


<a id="nestedblock--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
