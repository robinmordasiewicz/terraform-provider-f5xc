`mode` - (Optional) Mode. Mode in which the volume should be mounted to the workload - VOLUME_MOUNT_READ_ONLY: ReadOnly Mount the volume in read-only mode - VOLUME_MOUNT_READ_WRITE: Read Write Mount the volume in read-write mode. Possible values are `VOLUME_MOUNT_READ_ONLY`, `VOLUME_MOUNT_READ_WRITE`. Defaults to `VOLUME_MOUNT_READ_ONLY` (`String`).

`mount_path` - (Optional) Mount Path. Path within the workload container at which the volume should be mounted. Must not contain ':' (`String`).

`sub_path` - (Optional) Sub Path. Path within the volume from which the workload's volume should be mounted. Defaults to '' (volume's root) (`String`).

**Timeouts**

`create` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).

`delete` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs (`String`).

`read` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled (`String`).

`update` - (Optional) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](`HTTPS://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration`) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours) (`String`).
