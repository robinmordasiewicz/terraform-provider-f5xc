Using the f5xc-terraform MCP server, create a Terraform configuration for an origin pool with TLS.

Requirements:
- Use the f5xc_terraform_metadata tool with operation=example to get the correct syntax
- The origin pool should be named "test-origin-pool"
- Connect to example.com on port 443
- Enable TLS with automatic certificate verification
- Only output the Terraform configuration, no explanations
- Ensure the output passes terraform fmt validation
