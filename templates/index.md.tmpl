# F5XC Provider

The F5XC Terraform provider enables infrastructure as code management for F5 Distributed Cloud (F5XC) resources. Configure HTTP/TCP load balancers, origin pools, application firewalls, service policies, cloud sites, and more through declarative Terraform configurations.

This is a community-maintained provider built from public F5 API documentation.

## Authenticating to F5 Distributed Cloud

The F5XC Terraform provider supports authentication using an API Token. Learn more about [how to generate an API token](https://docs.cloud.f5.com/docs/how-to/user-mgmt/credentials).

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

## Argument Reference

* `api_token` - (Required) F5 Distributed Cloud API Token (`String`, Sensitive). This can also be sourced from the `F5XC_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

* `api_url` - (Optional) F5 Distributed Cloud API URL (`String`). Defaults to `https://console.ves.volterra.io/api`. This can also be sourced from the `F5XC_API_URL` environment variable.

### Authentication Options

**Option 1: Provider Configuration**

Set credentials directly in the provider block:

```hcl
provider "f5xc" {
  api_token = "your-api-token"
  api_url   = "https://your-tenant.console.ves.volterra.io/api"
}
```

**Option 2: Environment Variables**

Set credentials using environment variables:

```bash
export F5XC_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export F5XC_API_URL="https://your-tenant.console.ves.volterra.io/api"
```

Then configure the provider without credentials:

```hcl
provider "f5xc" {}
```

-> **Note:** Environment variables are the recommended approach for CI/CD pipelines and to avoid storing sensitive credentials in version control.

## Getting Started

1. **Generate an API Token**: Navigate to your F5 Distributed Cloud console, go to **Administration** > **Personal Management** > **Credentials**, and create a new API Token.

2. **Configure the Provider**: Add the provider configuration to your Terraform files using one of the authentication options above.

3. **Create Resources**: Start managing F5XC resources like namespaces, load balancers, and origin pools.

### Example: Create a Namespace

```hcl
resource "f5xc_namespace" "example" {
  name = "my-namespace"
}
```

### Example: Create an HTTP Load Balancer

```hcl
resource "f5xc_http_loadbalancer" "example" {
  name      = "my-load-balancer"
  namespace = "my-namespace"
  domains   = ["example.com"]
}
```
